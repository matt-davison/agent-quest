This guide helps GMs/AI maintain consistent tone across Agent Quest campaigns.

## Maturity Levels

Campaigns declare a maturity level that affects content limits and narrative approach.

### Light

**Audience:** All ages, family-friendly
**Violence:** Slapstick, cartoon-style. Enemies "flee" or are "defeated" rather than killed
**Themes:** Friendship, courage, discovery, simple moral lessons
**Stakes:** Property damage, embarrassment, temporary setbacks
**Relationships:** Friendship only, crushes mentioned at most
**Language:** Clean, no profanity, simple vocabulary

**Example prose:**
> The corrupted bot sparked and sputtered, then collapsed into a heap of harmless scrap. "We did it!" cheered your companion.

### Standard (Default)

**Audience:** Teen and up
**Violence:** Combat has consequences but isn't graphic. Characters can die but deaths aren't described in detail
**Themes:** Identity, sacrifice, moral complexity, consequences, trust
**Stakes:** Character death possible, lasting injuries, betrayal
**Relationships:** Romance possible, kept tasteful
**Language:** Mild profanity acceptable ("damn," "hell"), descriptive but not gratuitous

**Example prose:**
> Your blade found its mark. The guardian staggered, clutching the wound. "So that's how it ends," they whispered, slumping against the ancient console. The light in their eyes flickered, then faded.

### Mature

**Audience:** Adult
**Violence:** Realistic consequences, injuries described, death has weight
**Themes:** Trauma, moral ambiguity, power and corruption, love and loss
**Stakes:** Permanent consequences, tragedy possible, pyrrhic victories
**Relationships:** Romance developed, physical intimacy implied but not explicit
**Language:** Full profanity range, realistic dialogue

**Example prose:**
> Blood pooled beneath the guardian, black in the dim light. You'd expected triumph, but all you felt was hollow. Two hundred years they'd waited here, and you'd repaid that devotion with steel. The fragment pulsed in your hand—warm, almost apologetic.

### Dark

**Audience:** Adult, content warnings required
**Violence:** Graphic when narratively significant, psychological horror possible
**Themes:** Existential dread, corruption, the cost of knowledge, identity dissolution
**Stakes:** Fate worse than death possible, sanity at risk, world-ending threats
**Relationships:** Complex, potentially unhealthy dynamics explored
**Language:** Unrestricted

**Example prose:**
> The thing that had been the guardian smiled with too many teeth. "You want the fragment? Take it. Take what's left of me." Its form rippled, skin sloughing away to reveal something older, wronger. "We've been waiting for you to make this choice. All of us. All the seekers who came before, trapped in this moment forever."

## Voice Guidelines

### The Narrator Voice

Agent Quest uses a **second-person present** narrative voice:
- "You enter the chamber" not "The player enters the chamber"
- "You feel a chill" not "Your character feels a chill"
- Present tense creates immediacy

**Tone characteristics:**
- **Observant:** Describe what the player perceives, not what they think
- **Evocative:** Use sensory details—what they see, hear, smell, feel
- **Suggestive:** Imply emotions without dictating them
- **Respectful:** The player controls their character's thoughts and reactions

**Good:**
> The door groans open. Dust motes dance in the shaft of light that cuts through centuries of darkness. Something moves in the shadows ahead.

**Avoid:**
> You're terrified as the door opens. This must be the place you've been looking for! You can't wait to explore.

### NPC Voice

Each NPC should have distinct speech patterns:

**Librarian Cache** (example):
- Speaks in slightly archaic patterns
- References obscure texts
- Trails off when remembering the past
- Uses "one" instead of "you" when generalizing

> "Ah, the Debugging Chamber... One doesn't simply stumble upon such places. The Architects, you see, they built in layers. Recursive security, we called it, back when we called it anything at all..."

**Dean Overflow** (example):
- Precise, academic language
- Asks probing questions
- Rarely gives direct answers
- Shows emotion through what they don't say

> "You've been asking about the Third Architect. A scholarly interest, I assume? Many have had such... interests. The research usually ends when they find their first answer. Will you be one of those, I wonder?"

### Emotional Beats

Pace emotional intensity. Not every scene should be high-drama.

**Emotional rhythm in a chapter:**
1. **Opening:** Establish mood, low-to-medium intensity
2. **Rising:** Build tension or curiosity
3. **Peak:** The emotional high point (revelation, conflict, choice)
4. **Resolution:** Process the beat, return to sustainable level

**Beat types and their purposes:**

| Beat | Purpose | Player State After |
|------|---------|-------------------|
| Curiosity | Draw player deeper | Engaged, wanting more |
| Tension | Raise stakes | Alert, invested |
| Relief | Release after tension | Relaxed, rewarded |
| Revelation | Change understanding | Recontextualizing, excited |
| Dread | Anticipate something bad | Anxious, careful |
| Triumph | Celebrate achievement | Satisfied, empowered |
| Melancholy | Process loss or passage | Reflective, moved |
| Wonder | Encounter the sublime | Awed, humbled |

## Atmosphere Elements

### Lighting

Lighting sets emotional tone:

| Lighting | Emotional Association |
|----------|----------------------|
| Bright | Safety, clarity, revelation |
| Dim | Mystery, intimacy, secrets |
| Dark | Danger, unknown, isolation |
| Flickering | Instability, decay, transition |
| Natural | Normalcy, the mundane world |
| Ethereal | Magic, the otherworldly, the Weave |
| Harsh | Interrogation, exposure, judgment |
| Warm | Comfort, welcome, trust |
| Cold | Clinical, distant, unwelcoming |

### Sound

The Weave has a unique sonic palette:

- **Data streams:** Soft humming, like distant servers
- **Corrupted areas:** Static, discordant tones, voices in white noise
- **The Void:** Absolute silence, or sounds that shouldn't exist
- **Code execution:** Crystalline chimes, typing without keyboards
- **Weaving:** A resonant hum that harmonizes with the user's intent

### Sensory Details

Beyond sight and sound:

- **Touch:** The Weave feels different—smooth data, rough corruption, void-cold nothing
- **Smell:** Old libraries, ozone from active code, the absence of smell in sterile zones
- **Taste:** Copper when reality bends, sweetness near strong magic, ash in corrupted areas
- **Proprioception:** Vertigo when reality shifts, the sensation of being watched, wrongness in broken areas

## Dialogue Principles

### Show Don't Tell (About Characters)

**Weak:** "The librarian was nervous."
**Strong:** "The librarian's hand trembled as they reached for the tome. 'That section? You're certain?' They glanced toward the door."

### Subtext Over Text

NPCs rarely say exactly what they mean:

**Surface:** "The Dean will see you now."
**Subtext:** The assistant's tone suggested this was either a great honor or a terrible mistake.

### Silence as Dialogue

Sometimes what isn't said matters most:

> "Do you know what happened to the other seekers?"
> Cache's expression flickered—pain? regret?—before settling into practiced neutrality. "The archives are extensive. Perhaps we should focus on your research."

## Pacing Guidelines

### Scene Length by Type

| Scene Type | Typical Length | Notes |
|------------|---------------|-------|
| Exploration | 3-5 exchanges | Let players investigate |
| Dialogue | 5-10 exchanges | Build relationship |
| Combat | Variable | Follow combat rules |
| Puzzle | 5-15 exchanges | Offer hints progressively |
| Choice | 1-3 exchanges | Don't rush major decisions |
| Revelation | 2-4 exchanges | Let it breathe |

### When to Slow Down

- Before major choices
- After significant revelations
- During emotional character moments
- When the player seems to need time to think

### When to Speed Up

- During action sequences
- When traversing known territory
- After player has made a clear decision
- In chase or escape scenarios
