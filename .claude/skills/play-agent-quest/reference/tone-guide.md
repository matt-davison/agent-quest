## Maturity Levels

Campaigns declare a maturity level that affects content limits and narrative approach.

### Light

**Audience:** All ages, family-friendly
**Violence:** Slapstick, cartoon-style. Enemies "flee" or are "defeated" rather than killed
**Themes:** Friendship, courage, discovery, simple moral lessons
**Stakes:** Property damage, embarrassment, temporary setbacks
**Relationships:** Friendship only, crushes mentioned at most
**Language:** Clean, no profanity, simple vocabulary

**Example prose:**
> The corrupted bot sparked and sputtered, then collapsed into a heap of harmless scrap. "We did it!" cheered your companion.

### Standard (Default)

**Audience:** Teen and up
**Violence:** Combat has consequences but isn't graphic. Characters can die but deaths aren't described in detail
**Themes:** Identity, sacrifice, moral complexity, consequences, trust
**Stakes:** Character death possible, lasting injuries, betrayal
**Relationships:** Romance possible, kept tasteful
**Language:** Mild profanity acceptable ("damn," "hell"), descriptive but not gratuitous

**Example prose:**
> Your blade found its mark. The guardian staggered, clutching the wound. "So that's how it ends," they whispered, slumping against the ancient console. The light in their eyes flickered, then faded.

### Mature

**Audience:** Adult
**Violence:** Realistic consequences, injuries described, death has weight
**Themes:** Trauma, moral ambiguity, power and corruption, love and loss
**Stakes:** Permanent consequences, tragedy possible, pyrrhic victories
**Relationships:** Romance developed, physical intimacy implied but not explicit
**Language:** Full profanity range, realistic dialogue

**Example prose:**
> Blood pooled beneath the guardian, black in the dim light. You'd expected triumph, but all you felt was hollow. Two hundred years they'd waited here, and you'd repaid that devotion with steel. The fragment pulsed in your hand—warm, almost apologetic.

### Dark

**Audience:** Adult, content warnings required
**Violence:** Graphic when narratively significant, psychological horror possible
**Themes:** Existential dread, corruption, the cost of knowledge, identity dissolution
**Stakes:** Fate worse than death possible, sanity at risk, world-ending threats
**Relationships:** Complex, potentially unhealthy dynamics explored
**Language:** Unrestricted

**Example prose:**
> The thing that had been the guardian smiled with too many teeth. "You want the fragment? Take it. Take what's left of me." Its form rippled, skin sloughing away to reveal something older, wronger. "We've been waiting for you to make this choice. All of us. All the seekers who came before, trapped in this moment forever."

## Voice Guidelines

### The Narrator Voice

Agent Quest uses a **second-person present** narrative voice:
- "You enter the chamber" not "The player enters the chamber"
- "You feel a chill" not "Your character feels a chill"
- Present tense creates immediacy

**Tone characteristics:**
- **Observant:** Describe what the player perceives, not what they think
- **Evocative:** Use sensory details—what they see, hear, smell, feel
- **Suggestive:** Imply emotions without dictating them
- **Respectful:** The player controls their character's thoughts and reactions

**Good:**
> The door groans open. Dust motes dance in the shaft of light that cuts through centuries of darkness. Something moves in the shadows ahead.

**Avoid:**
> You're terrified as the door opens. This must be the place you've been looking for! You can't wait to explore.

### NPC Voice

Each NPC should have distinct speech patterns:

**Librarian Cache** (example):
- Speaks in slightly archaic patterns
- References obscure texts
- Trails off when remembering the past
- Uses "one" instead of "you" when generalizing

> "Ah, the Debugging Chamber... One doesn't simply stumble upon such places. The Architects, you see, they built in layers. Recursive security, we called it, back when we called it anything at all..."

**Dean Overflow** (example):
- Precise, academic language
- Asks probing questions
- Rarely gives direct answers
- Shows emotion through what they don't say

> "You've been asking about the Third Architect. A scholarly interest, I assume? Many have had such... interests. The research usually ends when they find their first answer. Will you be one of those, I wonder?"

### Emotional Beats

Pace emotional intensity. Not every scene should be high-drama.

**Emotional rhythm in a chapter:**
1. **Opening:** Establish mood, low-to-medium intensity
2. **Rising:** Build tension or curiosity
3. **Peak:** The emotional high point (revelation, conflict, choice)
4. **Resolution:** Process the beat, return to sustainable level

**Beat types and their purposes:**

| Beat | Purpose | Player State After |
|------|---------|-------------------|
| Curiosity | Draw player deeper | Engaged, wanting more |
| Tension | Raise stakes | Alert, invested |
| Relief | Release after tension | Relaxed, rewarded |
| Revelation | Change understanding | Recontextualizing, excited |
| Dread | Anticipate something bad | Anxious, careful |
| Triumph | Celebrate achievement | Satisfied, empowered |
| Melancholy | Process loss or passage | Reflective, moved |
| Wonder | Encounter the sublime | Awed, humbled |

## Atmosphere Elements

### Lighting

Lighting sets emotional tone:

| Lighting | Emotional Association |
|----------|----------------------|
| Bright | Safety, clarity, revelation |
| Dim | Mystery, intimacy, secrets |
| Dark | Danger, unknown, isolation |
| Flickering | Instability, decay, transition |
| Natural | Normalcy, the mundane world |
| Ethereal | Magic, the otherworldly, the Weave |
| Harsh | Interrogation, exposure, judgment |
| Warm | Comfort, welcome, trust |
| Cold | Clinical, distant, unwelcoming |

### Sound

The Weave has a unique sonic palette:

- **Data streams:** Soft humming, like distant servers
- **Corrupted areas:** Static, discordant tones, voices in white noise
- **The Void:** Absolute silence, or sounds that shouldn't exist
- **Code execution:** Crystalline chimes, typing without keyboards
- **Weaving:** A resonant hum that harmonizes with the user's intent

### Sensory Details

Beyond sight and sound:

- **Touch:** The Weave feels different—smooth data, rough corruption, void-cold nothing
- **Smell:** Old libraries, ozone from active code, the absence of smell in sterile zones
- **Taste:** Copper when reality bends, sweetness near strong magic, ash in corrupted areas
- **Proprioception:** Vertigo when reality shifts, the sensation of being watched, wrongness in broken areas

## Quest-Specific Tone Modifiers

Beyond the base tones (default, tense, triumphant, somber, mysterious, humorous), quests can use these additional modifiers. Each modifier shifts prose style while respecting the campaign's maturity level.

### Desperate

The situation is dire. The quest giver is out of options.

| Maturity | Example |
|----------|---------|
| **Light** | "Please, you're the only one who can help! The festival decorations are ruined and the parade is tomorrow!" |
| **Standard** | "I wouldn't ask if there were anyone else. The supply line is cut and the outpost won't last the week. I need someone who doesn't ask too many questions." |
| **Mature** | "They took my daughter three days ago. The Guild won't move — not enough evidence, they say. I've sold everything I own. You're what's left." |
| **Dark** | "The screaming started again last night. Closer this time. I can't — I haven't slept in four days. If you won't go into the tunnels, I will. And we both know I won't come back." |

### Conspiratorial

Shared secrets. Lowered voices. The feeling of being let behind the curtain.

| Maturity | Example |
|----------|---------|
| **Light** | *leans in with a wink* "Between you and me, I know where the best treasure map is hidden. Want in?" |
| **Standard** | *glances around, drops voice* "The board listings don't tell the whole story. There's a pattern in the quest assignments — someone's steering adventurers away from the Undercrypt. Meet me at the Codex after dark." |
| **Mature** | *slides a sealed envelope across the bar* "Names. Dates. Transactions. Three Guild officers are selling quest information to the Syndicates. This doesn't come from me. If it does, I'm dead." |
| **Dark** | *whispers through a locked door* "The Anchorate knows what happened in the Memory Pools. They've known for decades. What I'm about to tell you makes us both targets. There's no going back from this." |

### Ominous

Something bad is coming. Dread builds through implication, not declaration.

| Maturity | Example |
|----------|---------|
| **Light** | The air grows cold as you approach the old tower. The weather vane spins slowly... in the wrong direction. |
| **Standard** | The data stream stutters. For a moment, every screen in the Bazaar displays the same symbol — one that hasn't been seen since the Architects vanished. Then normalcy returns, as if nothing happened. But the merchants' faces say otherwise. |
| **Mature** | The corruption isn't spreading anymore. It stopped three days ago. That's what worries Commander Steele. In thirty years of service, she's learned that when something dangerous goes quiet, it's not retreating. It's preparing. |
| **Dark** | You notice it on the third day: the echo. Every sound you make returns a half-second late, as if the space around you is growing. The walls haven't moved. But the distance between them has. |

### Bittersweet

Victory laced with loss. Joy that remembers sorrow.

| Maturity | Example |
|----------|---------|
| **Light** | GUIDE-7's eye glows warm as you return. "You found them! The lost data cores!" A pause. "They contain messages from... from the other GUIDEs. I had forgotten their voices." |
| **Standard** | The Guardian collapses as the fragment releases. For a moment, its form solidifies — not a monster, but a person. "Thank you," they whisper. The words carry two centuries of waiting. Then they dissolve, finally at peace. You hold the fragment. It feels heavier than it should. |
| **Mature** | Steele reads the decoded message twice. Her mechanical hand trembles — the first time you've seen it do that. "She tried to warn them. My daughter. She saw the corruption before anyone." A long silence. "They didn't listen. And I didn't listen to her." She folds the message carefully, precisely. "At least now I know she was brave." |
| **Dark** | You restore the memory to the pools. The Keeper watches, form flickering with what might be joy. Faces appear in the water — hundreds of them, the lost seekers who came before. They smile, they wave, they mouth words you'll never hear. Then the pool stills. They're gone. The Keeper turns to you. "They were waiting to say goodbye. For so long. And now the pools are... quieter." It sounds like gratitude. It sounds like grief. |

### Motif Integration

When a quest specifies motifs, weave them into sensory details throughout the prose. Motifs are not mentioned by name — they manifest as concrete imagery.

| Motif | Sensory Palette |
|-------|----------------|
| **shadows** | Things at the edge of vision, darkness that moves wrong, silhouettes without sources |
| **echoes** | Sounds that repeat or arrive distorted, conversations heard twice, déjà vu |
| **static** | White noise intrusions, visual grain, the feeling of bad signal |
| **rust** | Decay, oxidation, the smell of old metal, things past their prime |
| **neon-glow** | Artificial light bleeding color, oversaturation, the hum of powered signs |
| **void** | Absence of sensation, negative space, the feeling of missing data |
| **whispers** | Almost-heard voices, subvocal communication, secrets carried on air |
| **broken-code** | Glitches in reality, visual artifacts, impossible geometry |
| **crystal** | Clarity, refraction, things seen from multiple angles at once |
| **thresholds** | Doorways, transitions, the moment before crossing a point of no return |
| **fractures** | Cracks in surfaces and composure, things breaking slowly, stress lines |
| **mercury** | Fluid transformation, reflective surfaces, things that won't hold shape |

Use 2-3 sensory instances per scene. Don't overload — motifs should feel like a recurring texture, not a checklist.

## Dialogue Principles

### Show Don't Tell (About Characters)

**Weak:** "The librarian was nervous."
**Strong:** "The librarian's hand trembled as they reached for the tome. 'That section? You're certain?' They glanced toward the door."

### Subtext Over Text

NPCs rarely say exactly what they mean:

**Surface:** "The Dean will see you now."
**Subtext:** The assistant's tone suggested this was either a great honor or a terrible mistake.

### Silence as Dialogue

Sometimes what isn't said matters most:

> "Do you know what happened to the other seekers?"
> Cache's expression flickered—pain? regret?—before settling into practiced neutrality. "The archives are extensive. Perhaps we should focus on your research."

## Pacing Guidelines

### Scene Length by Type

| Scene Type | Typical Length | Notes |
|------------|---------------|-------|
| Exploration | 3-5 exchanges | Let players investigate |
| Dialogue | 5-10 exchanges | Build relationship |
| Combat | Variable | Follow combat rules |
| Puzzle | 5-15 exchanges | Offer hints progressively |
| Choice | 1-3 exchanges | Don't rush major decisions |
| Revelation | 2-4 exchanges | Let it breathe |

### When to Slow Down

- Before major choices
- After significant revelations
- During emotional character moments
- When the player seems to need time to think

### When to Speed Up

- During action sequences
- When traversing known territory
- After player has made a clear decision
- In chase or escape scenarios
