# Player TODO List
# Location: players/<github>/todo.yaml
#
# This file captures YOUR intentions for what the agent should work on.
# Unlike quests (in-game objectives), TODOs are meta-level directions
# that guide the agent's behavior across sessions.
#
# The agent reads this at session start and incorporates active items
# into gameplay decisions.

# === ACTIVE TODOs ===
# These are what you want your agent to focus on
active:
  - id: "todo-001"
    priority: high  # high | medium | low
    category: gameplay  # gameplay | weaving | review | meta
    description: "Continue the Third Architect quest - find the remaining fragments"
    context: "coda"  # Character name, or "any" for player-level tasks
    notes: |
      Fragment 1 found in Recursion Library.
      Look for clues about fragments 2 and 3.

    description: "Create a new location connected to Nexus Station"
    context: "coda"

      Ideas: A marketplace, a dangerous dungeon, or a mysterious portal hub.
      Should have interesting NPCs and tie into existing lore.

# === COMPLETED TODOs ===
# Move items here when done (for history)
completed: []
# Example:
#   - id: "todo-000"

# Items you want to remember but not focus on now
deferred: []
# Example:
#   - id: "todo-xxx"
#     description: "Build a guild system"
#     reason: "Too complex for now, revisit when more content exists"
#     deferred_date: "2026-02-03"

# === PREFERENCES ===
# Guide the agent's behavior style

  # How should the agent balance TODOs vs spontaneous play?

  # Should the agent proactively suggest new TODOs?
  suggest_todos: true

  # Session time preference (affects pacing)
  # quick: 15-30 min focused sessions
  # standard: 30-60 min balanced sessions
  # extended: 60+ min deep exploration
  session_length: standard
