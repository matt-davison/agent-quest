# Per-Character World State Overrides
# File: worlds/<world>/players/<github>/personas/<character>/world-state.yaml
#
# These overrides take priority over global state in worlds/<world>/state/current.yaml
# for this specific character. Other characters will not see these changes.
#
# Use cases:
# - Quest unlocks an area only for the character who completed it
# - NPC moves to a new location due to character's actions
# - Environmental changes triggered by character-specific events
# - Flags that track character-specific world discoveries

# Areas unlocked specifically for this character
# These supplement global area access - character can access if EITHER global OR character unlocked
unlocked_areas:
  # - area_id: "nexus-undercrypt/fragment-chamber"
  #   unlocked_date: "2026-02-05"
  #   unlock_source: "quest:the-third-architect"
  #   notes: "Discovered the hidden entrance during The Third Architect quest"

# Character-specific area condition changes
# These OVERRIDE global area states for this character only

  #   original_state: "corrupted"
  #   notes: "Character purified the grove; other players still see corruption"

# When present, these take priority over global NPC locations and schedules
