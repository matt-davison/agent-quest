  A skittering mass of corrupted code given physical form, the Data Parasite
  resembles a spider made of flickering glitches and static. Its body constantly
  shifts between states, sometimes appearing solid, sometimes translucent.

  Parasites are drawn to sources of data and energy, feeding on the information
  they consume. Alone they're a nuisance; in swarms they can overwhelm and
  consume even experienced Weavers.

  They make a distinctive crackling sound as they move, like corrupted audio
  files playing simultaneously. Their "eyes" are bright red error indicators.

encounter_notes: |
  Data Parasites are most dangerous in groups of 4+. Their swarm bonus stacks
  significantly, and they'll naturally cluster on wounded targets.

  Tactics against parties:
  - 2-3 parasites per player character
  - Focus fire on lowest HP target
  - Scatter when area effects are used
  - Retreat toward corruption zones when damaged

  They're excellent for teaching new players about positioning and area denial.
  The Scatter ability makes area attacks feel fair while still being useful.

  Lightning damage kills them quickly - Datamancers and lightning weapons
  hard counter parasite swarms.
