- Async hook for tracking multiplayer state to run on stop and user prompt submit. Needs a lock
- Need to expose new multiplayer state relevant to the player (party invites, trades, etc.)
- Need to get multiplayer updates merged asap, special permission to land without review if only touching worlds/\*/multiplayer/\*\*? Script would help here
- A friends list
