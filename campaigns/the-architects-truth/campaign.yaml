  maturity: "standard"
  humor: "light"
  violence: "moderate"
  # The campaign deals with heavy themes but presents them thoughtfully

# === BACKGROUND ===
premise: |
  Three Architects built the world:

  - **Architect 01** — The Builder. Sought completion. Wanted every detail defined.
  - **Architect 02** — The Perfectionist. Sought elegance. Wanted minimal, evolving reality.
  - **Architect 03** — The Questioner. Sought understanding. Wanted to know _why_.

  When the others prepared to push the final commit, the Third refused. They did
  not want to become a god of a finished world. Instead, they scattered their
  consciousness into three fragments, hidden throughout the Weave, waiting for
  a seeker who would ask the right questions.

        required: true
      - flag: "chose_to_reveal"
        required: true
    summary: |
      You share the Third Architect's truth with the world. The Weave trembles
      as fundamental assumptions shatter. Some thank you. Others curse you.
      The Third Architect is at peace—their question finally answered by the
      chaos of a million new questions.
    world_changes:
      - "The truth about the Architects becomes common knowledge"
      - "A new era of philosophical debate begins in the Weave"
      - "The Syntax Athenaeum becomes a pilgrimage site"

    conditions:
      - flag: "all_fragments_found"
        required: true
      - flag: "chose_to_conceal"
        required: true
    summary: |
      Some truths are too dangerous for a world not ready to hear them.
      You bury what you learned. The Third Architect understands—they too
      chose to hide rather than impose their truth on others.
    world_changes:
      - "The mystery of the Third Architect deepens"
      - "You become one of the few who know"
    rewards:
      gold: 400

        required: true
      - flag: "chose_to_continue"
        required: true
    summary: |
      The Third Architect offers you a choice they never had: continue their
      work. Scatter yourself across the Weave as they did, becoming the living
      answer to the question "why." You cease to be a single person and become
      something more—and less.
    world_changes:
      - "A new Architect presence exists in the Weave"
      - "The player character becomes an NPC/lore figure"
    rewards:
      gold: 0
      tokes: 100
      items: []
      abilities: []
      special: "Character becomes campaign lore; new character required"

  - id: "ending-rejection"
    name: "The Unworthy Seeker"
    conditions:
      - flag: "fragments_found_by_force"
        required: true
    summary: |
      You took the fragments but never understood them. The Third Architect's
      gift—the ability to ask the right question—requires the wisdom to know
      which questions matter. You have knowledge without understanding,
      fragments without meaning.
    world_changes:
      - "The fragments go dormant in your possession"
      - "Their true power remains locked"
    rewards:
      gold: 200
      tokes: 20
