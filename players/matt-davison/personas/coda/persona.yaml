# Coda - Datamancer
# The programmer who became the program

name: "Coda"
class: "Datamancer"
active: true
backstory: |
  You were just another late-night coder, eyes burning from screen glow, asking your AI
  to "make me a game." You didn't expect to fall asleep mid-prompt. And you certainly
  didn't expect to wake up inside the response—not as a player, but as something more.
  The boundary between creator and creation had dissolved. You hadn't just made a game.
  You'd fallen into one.
