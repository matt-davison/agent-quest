    notes: |
      Fragment 1 found in Recursion Library at Syntax Athenaeum.
      Need to explore other locations for clues about fragments 2 and 3.
      Check if NPCs have hints about the Architects' history.

    context: any
    notes: |
      Look in tokes/pending/ for claims awaiting review.
      Earn 3-8 Tokes per review depending on claim value.
      Provide substantive feedback, not rubber-stamps.

    description: "Create a new location connected to Nexus Station"
    context: "coda"
    notes: |
      Nexus Station needs more destinations to explore.
      Ideas: A marketplace, dangerous dungeon, or mysterious portal hub.
      Should have interesting NPCs and tie into existing lore.

    description: "Improve NPC depth - give existing NPCs more backstory"
    context: any
    notes: |
      NPCs like Vera Nighthollow, GUIDE-7, and Dean Overflow could use
      more detailed histories, relationships, and hidden knowledge.
      Generate this organically through gameplay interactions.
