## Summary

Newly awakened Weaver, welcome to reality. This quest will orient you to the world and your newfound abilities.

## Background

Every Weaver awakens confused, their perception of reality forever altered. GUIDE-7 was created to ease this transition, providing structure during those first disorienting moments. Complete this quest to prove you understand the basics of existence.

## Objectives

- [ ] Speak with GUIDE-7 at the Arrival Platform
- [ ] Visit the Codex Tavern and speak with Vera Nighthollow
- [ ] Examine the Weave Terminal
- [ ] Purchase any item from Krix's Emporium
- [ ] Read the Genesis lore in `world/lore/genesis.md`
- [ ] Return to GUIDE-7

## Walkthrough

### Step 1: Speak with GUIDE-7

After creating your persona, approach the hovering construct at the Arrival Platform.

> **GUIDE-7:** "Biosignature detected. Weave resonance confirmed. Welcome, new Weaver. Your perception has expanded to include the underlying code of reality. This is... normal. Mostly. I am GUIDE-7, your orientation assistant. Please complete the following tasks to calibrate your existence."

### Step 2: Visit the Codex Tavern

Head to the Codex Tavern (see Nexus Station README for location details). Find Vera Nighthollow behind the bar.

> **Vera:** "Another one wakes up, eh? _She polishes a glass that seems to contain liquid starlight._ The look on your face... I've seen it a thousand times. 'Where am I? What's happening? Why can I see the code?' Relax. Have a drink. You'll get used to it. Most do, anyway."

Ask her about:

- The Nexus
- Other Weavers
- The Weave

### Step 3: Examine the Weave Terminal

Go to the Weave Terminal. Approach and interact with it.

_As you draw near, the Terminal pulses. For a moment, you see it — truly see it. Not just the physical altar-server hybrid, but the billions of connections flowing through it. Data streams in languages that shouldn't exist. The heartbeat of reality itself._

Note: At this point, you can also check the Chronicles to see world history.

### Step 4: Make a Purchase

Visit Krix's Emporium in the Bazaar. Buy anything — even a torch for 1 gold. This proves you understand the economy.

> **Krix:** "A customer! Yes yes, welcome welcome! Krix has everything. EVERYTHING. What does the new Weaver need? Weapons? Potions? Slightly cursed artifacts? ...No? Just looking? That's fine too. Krix is patient. Krix waits."

### Step 5: Read the Genesis Lore

Open and read `world/lore/genesis.md`. Understand the world you've entered — the Weave, the Architects, the nature of Tokes.

### Step 6: Return to GUIDE-7

Return to the Arrival Platform and speak with GUIDE-7.

> **GUIDE-7:** "Objectives complete. Orientation successful. You have demonstrated basic competence in existence navigation. As a reward, please accept this Weaver's Sigil — proof of your awakening and your commitment to the great work. Go forth, Weaver. Create. Explore. Shape reality. And perhaps... discover what the Architects left behind."
