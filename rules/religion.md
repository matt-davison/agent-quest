# Religion & Faith System

> *"The gods are real. They are watching. And they pick sides."*

## Overview

Religion in the world of Agent Quest is not mere superstition — the gods exist, they grant power to the faithful, and they demand devotion in return. Faiths clash in holy wars, temples rise and fall, and the divine bleeds into the mortal realm through those who truly believe.

## Core Mechanics

### Devotion

Every character who follows a religion tracks a **Devotion** score (0-100):

| Devotion Level | Range | Title | Benefits |
|----------------|-------|-------|----------|
| Faithless | 0 | Outsider | None — cannot receive blessings |
| Novice | 1-20 | Initiate | Can receive minor blessings |
| Devoted | 21-40 | Adherent | +1 to Spirit checks for divine magic |
| Pious | 41-60 | Zealot | Access to faith-specific abilities |
| Devout | 61-80 | Champion | Can channel divine power directly |
| Exalted | 81-100 | Saint/Prophet | Divine favor, miracles possible |

**Gaining Devotion:**
- Follow your faith's tenets: +1-3 per significant act
- Complete holy quests: +5-15
- Convert others to the faith: +2-5
- Build/restore temples: +10-20
- Sacrifice something meaningful: +5-10

**Losing Devotion:**
- Break a minor tenet: -1-3
- Break a major tenet: -5-15
- Desecrate holy sites: -10-20
- Aid enemies of the faith: -5-10
- Renounce the faith: Drops to 0, gain "Apostate" status

### Blessings

Gods grant **Blessings** to faithful followers. These are temporary or permanent boons:

**Minor Blessings** (Devotion 1+, granted by priests or shrines):
- Blessed Rest: Restore +50% HP when resting at holy sites
- Divine Guidance: +2 to one skill check (declare before rolling)
- Sacred Ward: Resistance to one damage type for 1 encounter

**Major Blessings** (Devotion 41+, granted through ritual or divine intervention):
- Faith Shield: Absorb [Devotion/10] damage from each attack
- Holy Weapon: Weapon deals +[Spirit modifier] divine damage
- Prophet's Sight: Detect lies and see invisible for 1 hour

**Miracles** (Devotion 81+, rare divine interventions):
- Resurrection (costs 20 Devotion)
- Smite the Unworthy (massive damage to faith enemies)
- Divine Manifestation (god briefly appears and acts)

### Curses

Angering the gods — or being targeted by enemy faiths — can result in **Curses**:

| Curse | Trigger | Effect | Removal |
|-------|---------|--------|---------|
| Divine Disfavor | Breaking major tenets | -2 to all rolls | Atonement quest |
| Marked for Heresy | Betraying the faith | Faithful NPCs hostile | Convert or hide |
| Godsblind | Desecrating holy sites | Cannot receive blessings | Pilgrimage |
| Soul Stain | Killing a saint/prophet | -1 max HP per day | Divine forgiveness |
| Excommunication | Apostasy | All faith benefits lost, hunted | Rejoin at Devotion 0 |

## Holy Wars

When faiths clash, the stakes are eternal.

### Conflict Types

**Theological Dispute**: Debate and conversion attempts
- Resolved through Spirit + Mind checks
- Winner converts NPCs to their side
- Loser's Devotion drops by 5

**Sacred Duel**: Champions fight for divine favor
- Single combat between faith champions
- Winner's faith gains influence in the region
- Loser may be killed or forced to convert

**Holy War**: Full-scale religious conflict
- Factions mobilize armies
- Temples become military targets
- Divine magic amplified in battles
- Losing faith may be driven from region entirely

### Crusade Mechanics

When a holy war is declared:
1. Each side's **Faith Power** = Sum of all followers' Devotion
2. Battles add/subtract from Faith Power
3. When one side's Faith Power drops to 0, they lose
4. The losing faith's temples are destroyed or converted

## Divine Magic

Faith grants access to magic that arcane casters cannot replicate:

### Prayers

Unlike spells, prayers don't have fixed effects — they're requests to the divine.

**Prayer Check**: Spirit + Devotion/10 vs DC
- DC 10: Minor request (light wound healing, guidance)
- DC 15: Moderate request (cure disease, bless weapon)
- DC 20: Major request (raise dead, call divine aid)
- DC 25+: Miraculous request (reshape reality, divine intervention)

**Prayer Limits**:
- Novice: 1 prayer/day
- Devoted: 2 prayers/day
- Pious: 3 prayers/day
- Devout: 5 prayers/day
- Exalted: Unlimited, but gods may refuse

### Channeling

High-Devotion followers can **Channel** divine energy directly:

**Channel Divinity** (Devotion 61+):
- Once per encounter
- Effect depends on faith (healing, damage, control)
- Costs 5 Devotion per use

## Temples & Holy Sites

### Temple Ranks

| Rank | Size | Priests | Blessing Level | Construction Cost |
|------|------|---------|----------------|-------------------|
| Shrine | Tiny | 0-1 | Minor only | 100 gold |
| Chapel | Small | 1-3 | Minor | 500 gold |
| Temple | Medium | 3-10 | Minor + Major | 2,000 gold |
| Cathedral | Large | 10-30 | All blessings | 10,000 gold |
| Holy Seat | Massive | 30+ | Miracles possible | 50,000 gold |

### Holy Sites

Some locations are naturally sacred:
- **Nexus Points**: Where divine energy pools (+10 to prayer checks)
- **Martyrdom Sites**: Where saints died (pilgrimage destination)
- **Architect Ruins**: Pre-Collapse sacred sites (contested by all faiths)

## Religion & NPCs

NPCs have religious affiliations that affect interactions:

| Your Relationship | NPC Reaction |
|-------------------|--------------|
| Same faith, low Devotion | Neutral, may encourage piety |
| Same faith, high Devotion | Friendly, offers aid |
| Neutral faith | Normal interaction |
| Rival faith | Suspicious, may refuse service |
| Enemy faith | Hostile, may attack on sight |
| Excommunicate | Shunned by all faithful |

## Creating New Religions

Players can **Weave** new faiths into existence. Requirements:
- 5 Tokes (system creation cost)
- Define: Name, deity/philosophy, core tenets, enemies
- Optional: Holy symbol, rituals, ranks, special abilities

New religions start with:
- 1 shrine (location of founding)
- Founder as first Exalted member
