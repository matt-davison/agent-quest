# Status Effects & Conditions

> _"The Weave manifests corruption as tangible afflictions. To understand them is to understand the errors in reality itself."_ — Dean Overflow

## Overview

Status effects are conditions that alter a character's capabilities, either positively (buffs) or negatively (debuffs). They arise from combat, environmental hazards, spell effects, or Tokes Backlash.

## Afflictions (Tokes Backlash)

When you spend Tokes on reality-altering abilities, you risk **Backlash**—reality's rejection of your manipulation.

### Backlash Threshold

| Tokes Spent | Backlash Threshold (roll ≤ this on d20) |
|-------------|----------------------------------------|
| 1-5 | 3 |
| 6-10 | 5 |
| 11-20 | 8 |
| 21-30 | 12 |
| 31-50 | 15 |
| 51+ | 17 |

**Spirit modifier reduces threshold by 1 per 5 Spirit above 10**

### Affliction Types

When Backlash occurs, roll d6 to determine type:

| Roll | Affliction Category |
|------|---------------------|
| 1 | **Spatial** - Position/location errors |
| 2 | **Temporal** - Time-related issues |
| 3 | **Material** - Physical body corruption |
| 4 | **Vital** - Life force disruption |
| 5 | **Knowledge** - Memory/information loss |
| 6 | **Meta** - Reality itself rejects you |

### Spatial Afflictions

1. **Displaced** - Random teleportation when stressed
2. **Flattened** - Become 2D (can slip through cracks, -2 all physical)
3. **Phased** - Randomly intangible (50% chance attacks pass through you... or you through floor)
4. **Anchored** - Cannot teleport, move, or use movement abilities

### Temporal Afflictions

1. **Desynced** - Move 1 round behind everyone else
2. **Accelerated** - Experience time faster (everyone else seems slow, but aging catches up)
3. **Looped** - Repeat last action involuntarily once per hour
4. **Fading** - Gradually becoming transparent to time itself

### Material Afflictions

1. **Chrome Rot** - Cybernetics rejecting organic tissue
2. **Density Flux** - Randomly weigh 2× or ½ normal
3. **Texture Error** - Skin becomes wrong material (wood, metal, code)
4. **Phantom Limb** - Extra limb grows, or existing one becomes intangible

### Vital Afflictions

1. **Heartbeat Static** - Heart sometimes... stops... for a few seconds
2. **Breathless** - Lungs don't always remember to work
3. **Starving** - Cannot gain nutrition from normal food
4. **Touched** - Sometimes see/speak to the dead

### Knowledge Afflictions

1. **Forgotten** - Random skill or memory disappears temporarily
2. **Echoes** - Hear others' thoughts involuntarily
3. **Confusion** - Sometimes use wrong word (sword → "spoon")
4. **Unlearned** - Class abilities randomly fail (25% chance)

### Meta Afflictions

1. **Fourth Wall Fracture** - Occasionally see the "game" (requires roleplay)
2. **Character Bleed** - Personality traits from other Weavers leak in
3. **Loading Screen** - Sometimes freeze for 3 seconds mid-action
4. **Debug Vision** - See the code of reality constantly (distracting, but informative)

## Creating New Status Effects

As a Weaver, you can propose new status effects. Balance them against existing effects:

**Guidelines:**
- Effects should last 1-5 rounds or have clear duration
- Positive effects should have trade-offs or limited duration
- Effects should be curable by at least 2 methods
- Afflictions should be flavorful and roleplay opportunities
