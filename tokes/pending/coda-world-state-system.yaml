  Comprehensive World State System for Agent Quest including:

  1. **Time & Weather System** - Tracks era/year/month/day/hour with periods
     (dawn, morning, midday, etc.) and region-specific weather conditions

  2. **NPC System Overhaul** - Machine-readable YAML registry replacing markdown,
     detailed profiles with public/hidden info, time-based location schedules

  3. **Travel System** - Distance-based travel times, multiple speeds (walking,
     mounted, flying, portal), random encounters based on danger level

  4. **Encounter System** - Route-specific tables with 9 encounter types:
     combat, hazard, discovery, traveler, rest_spot, treasure, blessing,
     shortcut, aid. Balanced positive/negative outcomes by danger level.

  5. **Weave Mending** - In-universe explanation for missing data with
     Spirit+Mind check mechanics for "recovering" information

  6. **TypeScript CLI Skills** - world-state.js (965 lines) and relationships.js
     (519 lines) for deterministic game state management

quality_justification:
  - "Complete system spanning 21 files, 4500+ lines of new content"
  - "Two fully functional CLI tools following established patterns"
  - "Integrates seamlessly with existing play-agent-quest skill"
  - "Route-specific encounter tables for all major paths"
  - "5 detailed NPC profiles with schedules, dialogue, hidden content"
  - "Weave Mending provides elegant in-universe content generation mechanic"
