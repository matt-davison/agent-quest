description: |
  An old data chip, scratched and worn, held together by hope. It contains
  the last known coordinates of Yara Corren — a woman who hunted the Third
  Architect forty-three years ago and vanished without a trace.

  Her father Vance kept this for decades, too afraid to follow. Now it's
  in your hands.

  type: coordinates
  location: "Unknown — requires decryption or the right equipment"
  age: "43 years old"
  sender: "Yara Corren"
  notes: |
    The chip's data is partially corrupted. A skilled technician or
    Datamancer might be able to extract the full coordinates.

lore: |
  Yara Corren was one of many who sought the truth about Architect 03.
  Unlike most, she found something. Her last message to her father
  contained a memory and these coordinates. Then silence.

  "Everyone who looked for her vanished," Vance said. "Everyone except me."
