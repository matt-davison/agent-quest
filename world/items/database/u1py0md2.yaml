description: |
  A small crystalline vial filled with something that shifts between liquid
  and light. Colors swirl inside: deep blue, flashes of gold, a pulse of
  something that might be pain. It's warm to the touch, and holding it too
  long brings faint echoes of emotion not your own.

lore: |
  Memory vials are crafted by those who deal in the currency of experience.
  The Jade Dragon is known to broker such things — buying painful memories
  from those who wish to forget, selling precious ones to those who wish
  to remember what was never theirs.
