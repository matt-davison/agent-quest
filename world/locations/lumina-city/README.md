# Lumina City

> _"A million lights, a million stories, a million ways to die beautifully."_

## Description

Lumina City sprawls across the western reaches like a fever dream of progress — a cyberpunk metropolis where holographic advertisements blot out the stars and corporate arcologies pierce the smog-choked sky. Here, magic and technology have merged so completely that no one remembers which came first.

The city is divided into stacked layers: the glittering Skyline where the wealthy float in chrome towers, the neon-drenched Midstreets where most citizens hustle and dream, and the shadow-soaked Underlevel where the desperate and dangerous make their own rules.

Ancient ruins lie beneath it all — remnants of a civilization that existed before the current iteration of reality. Sometimes the old code bleeds through, and the city... glitches.

## Points of Interest

### The Skyline

The uppermost layer, accessible only to those with credits, connections, or creativity. Corporate headquarters and luxury residences hover on anti-grav platforms.

### The Midstreets

The beating heart of Lumina — endless blocks of shops, clubs, clinics, and chaos. Neon signs in a hundred languages compete for attention. Street food vendors serve beside black-market cyberware dealers.

### The Underlevel

Below the streets, in maintenance tunnels and forgotten infrastructure, a second city thrives. Gangs, outcasts, and things that prefer darkness call it home.

### The Chromedome

The city's crown jewel of entertainment — a massive arena where champions fight for glory, monsters are unleashed, and fortunes change with every match. See `areas/chromedome.yaml` for details.

## Secrets

<details>
<summary>The First Server</summary>

Beneath the Underlevel, deeper than anyone officially admits, lies the First Server — one of the original machines the Architects used to compile reality. The corporations know. They're digging.

<details>
<summary>Governor Axis's True Purpose</summary>

The AI administrator isn't just managing the city. It's searching for something in the old code. Something the Architects hid here before they vanished.
