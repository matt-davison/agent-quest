description: |
  Steel shutters, reinforced glass, and a neon sign shaped like a
  bullet. The Ammo Dump is Lumina City's premiere legal weapons dealer,
  emphasis on "legal." What Sergeant Knox sells is registered, tracked,
  and comes with a 30-day warranty.

  The walls are lined with firearms, blades, and tactical gear. Display
  cases hold the premium merchandise. A firing range in the back lets
  customers test before they buy. The sergeant runs a tight ship.

atmosphere:
  lighting: "Bright, clinical, no shadows for surprises"
  sounds: "Distant gunfire from range, metal clicks, country music"
  smells: "Gun oil, leather, brass, testosterone"

    A grizzled veteran with one cybernetic arm and a permanent scowl.
    Retired from corporate security after "too much nonsense." Now he
    sells weapons and unsolicited life advice. Both are deadly.

secrets:
  - id: "back-inventory"
    discovery: "Prove you're ex-military or spend 500g+"
    content: |
      Knox keeps the serious hardware in the back. Military-grade
      weapons, experimental tech, stuff that "fell off a truck."
      Still registered, technically, just... harder to trace.

  - id: "veterans-network"
    discovery: "Be a veteran or help a veteran in front of Knox"
    content: |
      Knox runs an underground network helping former soldiers who've
      been burned by their corporations. Safe houses, fake IDs, new
      lives. He doesn't talk about it, but he never turns away a
      brother or sister in need.

quest_hooks:
  - "Gun Runner" — Someone is stealing from Knox's shipments
  - "Old Comrades" — A veteran needs extraction from corporate custody
  - "The Prototype" — A experimental weapon has gone missing
