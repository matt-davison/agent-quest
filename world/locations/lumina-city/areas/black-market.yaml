  The chrome-armed bouncer doesn't ask for ID. He asks for the password.
  Get it right, and you descend a narrow staircase into a sprawling
  underground bazaar where legality is a suggestion and everything has
  a price.

  Stalls crowd against each other in a maze of stolen goods, forbidden
  tech, illegal substances, and services that don't officially exist.
  The lighting is dim. The clientele is dangerous. And somewhere in the
  back, the real players make deals that shape the underworld.

      There's a market beneath the market. The Void Bazaar, they call it.
      Where the truly forbidden things are sold — Architect artifacts,
      bound entities, memories extracted from the dying. You need a
      sponsor to even know it exists.

      you're crossing the Saints everywhere.
