description: |
  Squeezed between a pawn shop and a condemned building, the Cyberclinic's
  flickering sign promises "UPGRADES - REPAIRS - NO QUESTIONS." The interior
  is surprisingly clean — sterile white tiles, humming medical equipment,
  and the faint smell of antiseptic and solder.

  Dr. Vex operates here, one of the best street docs in Lumina. She left
  corporate medicine after seeing too much. Now she patches up anyone who
  walks through the door, no judgment, cash only.

atmosphere:
  lighting: "Clinical white LEDs, occasional sparks from equipment"
  sounds: "Medical monitors beeping, servo whirs, muffled screams from back room"
  smells: "Antiseptic, ozone, synthetic blood"

    A tall woman with chrome-plated forearms and eyes that see in spectrums
    humans weren't meant to perceive. Calm, professional, utterly unflappable.
    She's seen worse than whatever you're bringing in.
