  legitimate. Totally above-board.

  Unless you know to ask for "the special menu."

  information broker in Lumina City. She knows everyone's secrets. And
  everyone's secrets know her.

    She appears as a middle-aged woman with kind eyes and silver hair,
    but that's just the hologram she projects into the booth. Her real
    body — if she still has one — is somewhere in the city's data
    infrastructure. She IS Lumina City's information network, in a very
    literal sense.

    content: |
      Madam Circuit's original body is in cryogenic storage beneath
      Governor Axis's office. The AI administrator is blackmailing her —
      she provides intelligence, Axis doesn't pull the plug.

    content: |
      Before the term 'Weaver' existed, there were the Codebreakers — a
      group who first learned to perceive and manipulate the underlying
      reality. Madam Circuit was one of them. She knows what happened to
      the others. She won't say without significant trust.

  - "The Information War" — Someone is hunting information brokers
  - "Circuit Breaker" — Help Madam Circuit escape Axis's control
