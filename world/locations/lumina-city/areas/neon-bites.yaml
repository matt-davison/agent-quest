  A hovering food cart surrounded by plastic stools and the permanent smell
  of frying oil. Neon Bites has been a Midstreet institution for decades,
  serving cheap, filling food to workers, gangers, and anyone else with a
  few gold to spare and not too many questions about ingredients.

  The menu changes daily based on what Grix can source. The regulars know
  not to ask about the "mystery meat Monday" special.

atmosphere:
  lighting: "Harsh fluorescent from the cart, neon spill from nearby signs"
  sounds: "Sizzling grill, street traffic, Grix's constant muttering"
  smells: "Grease, spices, something that might be onions"

  name: "Grix"
  description: |
    A stocky goblin-kin with four arms (two original, two cybernetic) who
    works the grill with terrifying efficiency. Gruff, impatient, secretly
    kind. Has fed more hungry kids for free than he'd ever admit.

      Grix runs an informal network helping people disappear from corporate
      attention. The food cart is a dead drop for messages and supplies.
