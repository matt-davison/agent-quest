  From the outside, it looks like any other Midstreet shop — slightly
  run-down, neon sign flickering. Step inside, and you enter a world of
  impossible fabrics and whispered measurements.

  The walls are lined with bolts of cloth that shimmer with embedded
  circuitry, leather that came from no natural animal, and silk spun from
  harvested moonlight. Mannequins display outfits that could stop bullets,
  turn aside blades, or make you invisible at a party.

atmosphere:
  lighting: "Soft, flattering light that makes everything look better"
  sounds: "Scissors snipping, sewing machines humming, classical music"
  smells: "Fine leather, expensive fabric, a hint of magic"

  description: |
    A thin, precise individual of uncertain gender and certain talent.
    Their fingers move faster than eyes can track, and they can assess
    your measurements, threat level, and net worth in a single glance.
    Speaks in clipped, efficient sentences.

      Needle was the legendary assassin known as "The Seamstress" —
      twelve confirmed kills, all made to look like accidents involving
      clothing malfunctions. They retired after falling in love with
      their final target, who they couldn't bring themselves to kill.

      that fools even medical scanners. The process takes a week and is
      extremely painful. Only three exist in the world.
