# The Dive
# Cheap tavern, rough clientele, invaluable gossip

id: "the-dive"
name: "The Dive"
parent_location: "lumina-city"
type: "tavern"
tier: 1

  There's no sign. The door is unmarked. You find The Dive by knowing
  where it is, or by being desperate enough to push through every
  suspicious door until something doesn't try to kill you.

  Inside, it's exactly what you'd expect: sticky floors, dim lighting,
  booths with suspicious stains, and a bar that's survived more fights
  than most armies. The drinks are cheap, the company is cheaper, and
  the information flowing through here is priceless — if you know how
  to listen.

atmosphere:
  lighting: "Barely functional neon, one flickering bulb, shadows"
  sounds: "Muttered conversations, clinking glasses, occasional fights"
  smells: "Stale beer, smoke, sweat, regret"

proprietor:
  id: "sal"
  name: "Sal"
  description: |
    An ancient bartender of indeterminate species — they might be human,
    might be something else, might have been here since before the city
    existed. Sal doesn't talk much. Sal sees everything. Sal remembers
    everything. Cross Sal, and you'll never drink in this city again.
  dialogue_hook: "*Sal looks at you, waits, looks at the tap.*"
  secrets:
    - "Has been bartending in this exact spot for 200+ years"
    - "Knows secrets that could topple governments"
    - "May not be entirely real — some say Sal is a glitch, a persistent error"

regulars:
  description: |
    The Dive attracts a specific clientele: off-duty gangers, down-on-luck
    mercs, information sellers, people who need to disappear for a few
    hours. The smart ones keep to themselves. The dumb ones don't last.

secrets:
  - id: "sal-nature"
    discovery: "Observe Sal over multiple visits (5+)"
    content: |
      Sal doesn't eat, doesn't sleep, doesn't leave. The older patrons
      remember Sal from their parents' stories. The really old ones
      remember Sal from their grandparents'. Some theorize Sal is a
      fixed point in reality — something the Architects wrote that
      can't be changed.

  - id: "back-room-tunnel"
    discovery: "Rent the back room, examine carefully (Perception DC 15)"
    content: |
      A hidden tunnel in the back room leads to the Underlevel. It's
      how certain people enter and exit the city without being seen.
      Sal knows. Sal doesn't care.

  - id: "message-board-code"
    discovery: "Study the message board (Mind DC 14)"
    content: |
      The public job listings are cover. The real messages are coded —
      assassination contracts, heist planning, revolutionary organizing.
      Knowing the code opens dangerous doors.
