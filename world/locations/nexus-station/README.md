# Nexus Station

> _Where all threads converge, where all journeys begin._

## Description

Nexus Station exists at the crossroads of reality itself — a massive structure that seems to occupy multiple dimensions simultaneously. Its architecture defies easy description: Gothic spires wrapped in holographic advertisements, ancient stone walkways lined with fiber-optic cables, stained glass windows that display real-time data streams instead of saints.

The air hums with power — both magical and electrical. Ethereal wisps drift alongside delivery drones. The smell of ozone mingles with incense from a dozen different temples. Somewhere, a bard plays synth-lute while a merchant hawks enchanted USB drives.

This is where Weavers gather. Newcomers arrive disoriented, their Sight newly awakened, struggling to process a reality they can suddenly perceive in two layers — the rendered world and the code beneath. Veterans stride through with purpose, their modifications to reality visible in the confident way they navigate spaces that shouldn't exist.

## Points of Interest

### The Arrival Platform

A circular plaza of crystalline tiles that pulse with soft light. New Weavers materialize here, drawn by forces they don't yet understand. A helpful construct called **GUIDE-7** hovers nearby, ready to orient the newly awakened.

**Interactions:**

- Speak with GUIDE-7 for orientation
- Examine the Awakening Obelisk for lore
- Meet other newly arrived Weavers

### The Bazaar of Infinite Goods

A sprawling marketplace where merchants from across reality hawk their wares. Stalls sell everything from healing potions to hacking tools, ancient grimoires to neural implants.

**Interactions:**

- Buy and sell equipment
- Gather rumors and quest hooks
- Find rare items (stock rotates)

### The Codex Tavern

A three-story establishment where Weavers rest, drink, and share stories. The first floor is a rowdy bar, the second a quieter lounge, the third private rooms for rent.

**Interactions:**

- Rest to restore HP (10 gold/night)
- Hear rumors from patrons
- Find quest-givers
- Meet other players

### The Weave Terminal

A massive structure resembling both an ancient altar and a server rack. Here, Weavers can interface directly with the underlying code of reality.

**Interactions:**

- Access the Weave to create content
- Spend Tokes for special abilities
- View the Chronicles of contributions
- Check world state and updates

### The Guild Hall

Headquarters for the various Weaver disciplines. Each class has a wing with trainers, resources, and class-specific quests.
