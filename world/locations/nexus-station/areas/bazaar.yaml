description: |
  A sprawling marketplace where merchants from across reality hawk their wares.
  Stalls sell everything from healing potions to hacking tools, ancient grimoires
  to neural implants. The air is thick with competing scents of exotic spices,
  machine oil, and arcane reagents. Holographic advertisements float overhead
  while hawkers shout their wares in a dozen languages.
