  A three-story establishment where Weavers rest, drink, and share stories.
  The architecture shifts between rustic fantasy inn and sleek lounge bar
  depending on which floor you're on. The first floor is a rowdy bar with
  bards and arm-wrestling contests. The second floor is a quieter lounge
  for serious conversation. The third floor holds private rooms for rent.
