  A massive structure resembling both an ancient altar and a server rack.
  Cables of pure light connect to crystalline nodes that pulse with the
  heartbeat of reality itself. Here, Weavers can interface directly with
  the underlying code of existence. The air crackles with potential, and
  those with Weave Sight can see the threads of reality converging here.
