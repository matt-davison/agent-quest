description: |
  A meditation space where Weavers learn to perceive errors in the code of
  reality. The room is perfectly silent—no data flows here. In this absence,
  flaws become visible. The walls are smooth and white, the floor cushioned.
  Students sit in circles, learning to see what shouldn't be there.
