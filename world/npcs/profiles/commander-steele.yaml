# Quest Board Administrator at The Guild Hall

id: "commander-steele"
name: "Commander Steele"
full_name: "Commander Elara Steele"

# === PUBLIC INFORMATION ===
public:
  role: "Quest Board Administrator"
  location: "Nexus Station - Guild Hall"

  appearance: |
    A stern human woman in her late forties with iron-grey hair cut military
    short. Her most striking feature is her mechanical left arm—burnished
    bronze and clearly functional rather than decorative. Her remaining eye
    is sharp and ice-blue; the other is covered by a simple black patch.
    She wears a crisp Guild uniform bearing numerous service medals and
    stands with the rigid posture of someone who has spent decades in command.

  personality:
    - "No-nonsense and direct to a fault"
    - "High standards, higher expectations"
    - "Respects competence over all else"
    - "Surprisingly fair despite strictness"

  known_history: |
    Commander Steele served in the Guild's military arm for thirty years
    before taking over quest administration. She lost her arm and eye in
    what she only refers to as "the incident." Now she ensures that
    adventurers are properly vetted and missions are properly completed.
    She has no patience for excuses but rewards success appropriately.

  speech_patterns:
    greeting: "Name and business. Make it quick."
    farewell: "Dismissed. Don't come back until it's done."
    approval: "Acceptable work. The Guild takes note."
    disapproval: "This is not what I asked for. Fix it."

  mannerisms:
    - "Mechanical arm whirs when she's thinking"
    - "Taps fingers on desk when impatient"
    - "Stands when delivering important news"
    - "Eye softens almost imperceptibly when impressed"

# === DIALOGUE ===
dialogue:
  greetings:
    first_meeting: |
      *looks up from paperwork* New recruit? Fill out these forms. Complete
      orientation with GUIDE-7. Then we'll talk about assignments. The
      Guild doesn't coddle.

    returning:
      neutral: "You. Report. What's the status of your assignment?"
      friendly: "{player_name}. Good to see you back in one piece. Report, then... we can talk."
      close: "*slight nod* {player_name}. You've earned the right to skip the line. What do you need?"

  achievement_reactions:
    first_quest_complete: |
      *reviews report* Clean work. No unnecessary complications. The Guild
      rates you competent. That's not an insult—competent keeps you alive.

    difficult_quest_complete: |
      *mechanical arm whirs as she reads* This was... above expectations.
      The Guild takes note. So do I. *stamps approval*

  topics:
    quests:
      default: |
        The board lists available contracts. Read descriptions carefully.
        Accept only what you can complete. Failed quests reflect on your
        record—and my judgment for approving you.

    her_past:
      default: "*mechanical arm flexes* I served. I survived. That's all that matters."
      standing_4: "Thirty years in the field. Lost some things along the way. *touches patch* Gained others."
      standing_7: |
        *long pause* The incident... A construct. Corrupted Architect code.
        Village needed evacuation. I bought them time. *arm whirs* Worth
        the cost. Mostly.

    the_guild:
      default: |
        The Guild maintains order. We assign quests, verify completions,
        and ensure adventurers meet minimum standards. Without us, it's
        chaos.
      standing_5: |
        Between us—I've noticed irregularities. Quests appearing that
        shouldn't. Assignments that don't match protocols. Someone's
        playing games with my board. I intend to find out who.
