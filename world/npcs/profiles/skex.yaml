# NPC Profile: Skex
# Data-runner on the run from the Pale Circuit

id: "skex"
name: "Skex"
full_name: "Unknown"  # He hasn't shared it

# === PUBLIC INFORMATION ===
public:
  role: "Data-Runner (former)"
  location: "undercrypt-bone-market"  # Current, fleeing

  appearance: |
    Early twenties, gaunt face with sharp cheekbones. Three chrome data-jacks
    run down his left temple like teardrops. Messy dark hair that falls into
    his eyes. Lean build — underfed in that way data-runners get when they
    spend more on jack upgrades than food. Long, quick fingers that never
    stop moving. Wears a threadbare hoodie over whatever he grabbed running
    out the door.

  personality:
    - "Nervous, twitchy — always looking over his shoulder"
    - "Surprisingly brave when cornered"
    - "Quick to trust those who help him"
    - "Self-deprecating humor as a defense mechanism"

  known_history: |
    Skex worked as a data-runner — jacking into systems, downloading packages,
    no questions asked. His last job for the Pale Circuit went wrong when he
    looked at the data he was carrying: coordinates to every skolma stash in
    the lower levels. Now he's running for his life with information that
    could destroy the Circuit's supply chain.

  speech_patterns:
    nervous: "You, uh... you good? We should, uh, probably keep moving."
    grateful: "You're incredible. You know that? Actually incredible."
    scared: "They're gonna kill me. They're gonna kill both of us."
    hopeful: "Maybe... maybe we can actually make it."

  mannerisms:
    - "Scratches at his data-jacks when anxious"
    - "Runs hand through messy hair constantly"
    - "Fingers always tapping, fidgeting"
    - "Makes eye contact briefly then looks away"
    - "Nervous laugh when stressed"

    Skex is developing feelings for Zynita. The phase through the wall
    was an intimate experience — heartbeats synced, bodies pressed together
    in the between-space. He's scared but he trusts her. Whether that trust
    is warranted remains to be seen.

# === DIALOGUE ===
dialogue:
  greetings:
    first_meeting: |
      *scratches at his jacks* You, uh... you really did that, huh?
      Just made a whole religion? Right there?

    friendly: |
      *nervous smile* Hey. You, uh... you ready to keep moving?

  topics:
    the_data:
      default: |
        Every stash. Every dead drop. Every safe house. The Circuit's
        whole supply chain. If this gets out, they're finished.

    the_circuit:
      default: |
        *shudders* They don't forgive. They don't forget. If they catch
        us, we're not getting a quick death.

    himself:
      default: |
        *shrugs* I'm nobody. Just a runner who got curious. Bad habit.
      standing_4: |
        *long pause* I had a sister. She... the skolma got her. I wanted
        to know where it came from. Who was responsible.

    zynita:
      standing_2: |
        You're... not what I expected. Most Voidwalkers I've met are cold.
        Distant. You're... *trails off, looks away*
