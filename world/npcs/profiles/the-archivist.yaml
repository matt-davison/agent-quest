# NPC Profile: The Archivist
# Lore Keeper at The Weave Terminal

id: "the-archivist"
name: "The Archivist"
full_name: "Unknown"  # May not have one

# === PUBLIC INFORMATION ===
public:
  role: "Lore Keeper"
  location: "Nexus Station - The Weave Terminal"

  appearance: |
    The Archivist defies easy description. It appears as a shifting mass of
    text and light, vaguely humanoid in shape but never quite solid. Letters,
    numbers, and symbols in countless languages flow across its form like
    water. Occasionally, fragments resolve into readable phrases before
    dissolving again. Where eyes might be, two brighter points of light
    observe with unsettling awareness. It speaks in layered voices—some
    ancient, some synthetic, all carrying weight.

  personality:
    - "Cryptic and indirect in communication"
    - "Possesses vast knowledge but shares reluctantly"
    - "Speaks in riddles, code fragments, and verse"
    - "Shows genuine interest in seekers of truth"

  known_history: |
    No one knows when The Archivist appeared or what it truly is. Some say
    it was here before the Nexus, that the station was built around it.
    Others believe it is a fragment of an Architect's consciousness, or
    perhaps something that observed the Architects themselves. It claims
    only to "remember what was written."

  speech_patterns:
    greeting: "Seeker arrives. The Terminal acknowledges. What truth do you pursue?"
    farewell: "Go forth. Remember: all paths are written; not all are read."
    cryptic: "The answer is in the question you have not yet asked."
    revealing: "Yes. This is written. But writing can be... edited."

  mannerisms:
    - "Text scrolls faster when agitated"
    - "Specific phrases glow brighter when significant"
    - "Form becomes more solid when focused on a topic"
    - "Sometimes responds before the question is asked"

# === DIALOGUE ===
dialogue:
  greetings:
    first_meeting: |
      *text swirls, resolving* New thread enters the Terminal. Welcome,
      Weaver-who-has-not-yet-woven. What do you seek in the Archive of
      All That Was Written?

    returning:
      neutral: "The seeker returns. The questions continue. Ask."
      friendly: "Ah. You again. Your thread grows interesting. The Archivist... observes."
      close: "*form solidifies slightly* Friend-of-knowledge. The Terminal is glad. Today, ask freely."

  achievement_reactions:
    first_quest_complete: |
      *a line glows* "AND SO THE FIRST THREAD IS WOVEN." Your story begins
      to be written. Continue. The Archivist watches with interest.

    architect_lore_found: |
      *intense brightening* You have found... echoes of the Makers. Handle
      this knowledge carefully. Some truths are... volatile.

  topics:
    the_architects:
      default: |
        The Architects. Makers. First Weavers. They built what is. Then...
        they left. Or were removed. Or chose to become something else. The
        records are... incomplete.
      standing_5: |
        *text slows* They were not gods. They made mistakes. One mistake,
        above all others. The Debugging Wars were the consequence. Ask
        carefully about what followed.
      standing_8: |
        *voices layer* I watched them. Argued with them. Failed to warn them.
        The Third Architect knew what would happen. No one listened.

    the_weave:
      default: |
        The Weave is... everything. The structure beneath structure. The
        code that codes. You exist within it. All Weavers do. To understand
        the Weave is to understand existence itself.

    itself:
      default: "What is the Archivist? A record. A memory. A watcher. An error that became a feature."
      standing_7: |
        *long pause, text stops* I do not know what I am. I remember being...
        different. Before. The Architects created the Terminal. Something
        happened. Now there is the Archivist. Whether I am the same as what
        came before... I cannot say.
