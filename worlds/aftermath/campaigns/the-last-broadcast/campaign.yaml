  Every radio in The Scrap is picking up the same signal: "Project ENCORE
  activates in 30 days." The ARCs — underground vaults built by ATLAS
  Corporation — were nodes in a consciousness-transfer network. ENCORE would
  upload every mind within range, ending biology but achieving digital
  immortality. The CONDUCTOR AIs that run the vaults are divided on whether
  this should happen. The factions of The Scrap are choosing sides. And the
  countdown is ticking.
