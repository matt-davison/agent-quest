  Not all vault dwellers made it out sane. Ferals are humans who absorbed
  too much radiation over too many years — their minds burned away, leaving
  only animal instinct and rage. They're emaciated, scarred, and
  fast — much faster than they should be. Their skin is mottled with
  radiation burns, and they give off a faint glow in the dark. They don't
  use weapons (anymore) but their fingernails have hardened into something
  like claws, and they bite.

  They haunt the ruins in small groups, nesting in dark places — basements,
  collapsed buildings, vault corridors. They avoid daylight. They avoid
  fire. They do not avoid anything else. Wasteland travelers learn to
  check the shadows and listen for the wet, hitching breathing.

encounter_notes: |
  Ferals are the humanoid enemy that teaches players about radiation
  mechanics and environmental advantages. They're tragic — each one
  was a person once.

  Combat tactics:
  - Ambush from darkness with Frenzied Lunge
  - Surround targets using speed advantage
  - Radiation Aura punishes melee clustering
  - Undying Rage creates uncertainty after kills

  Counters:
  - Fire damage and bright light sources
  - Area attacks to handle groups
  - Ranged attacks to avoid Radiation Aura
  - Confirming kills (attack downed Ferals to prevent Undying Rage)
  - Fighting in well-lit areas removes their ambush advantage

  Note: Ferals occasionally wear scraps of vault jumpsuits or carry
  personal items, reminding players these were people. Good for lore.
