category: irradiated
tier: standard
level: 3

description: |
  A beetle the size of a golden retriever, its carapace a dull metallic
  red that pulses with internal heat. Furnace Beetles nest in old
  industrial sites — foundries, power plants, anywhere with residual
  heat. Their bodies have evolved to process radioactive material as
  fuel, converting it to intense thermal energy stored in a specialized
  organ behind their mandibles.

  When threatened, they rear up and spray a jet of superheated liquid
  from glands in their thorax — essentially biological napalm. The
  spray ignites on contact with air. Factory workers call them
  "walking Zippos" and avoid their nests religiously.

encounter_notes: |
  Furnace Beetles are area-denial enemies that punish clustering.
  They force players to spread out and use ranged attacks.

  Combat tactics:
  - Positions for maximum Fire Spray coverage
  - Fights to the death near flammable materials
  - Exploits narrow spaces for unavoidable cone attacks
  - Death explosion punishes melee-heavy groups

  Counters:
  - Cold and water damage are highly effective
  - Flanking bypasses Armored Carapace
  - Ranged attacks avoid death explosion
  - Spreading out limits Fire Spray effectiveness
  - Kill from range to avoid Volatile Death
