tier: minion
level: 1

description: |
  A rat the size of a small dog, with patchy fur and skin that's taken on
  the orange-brown color of rusted metal. Its teeth — oversized, serrated,
  and faintly glowing — can gnaw through steel pipe. Rust Rats nest in
  ventilation systems, collapsed buildings, and anywhere with enough scrap
  metal to chew on. They're not smart, but they're numerous, aggressive
  when cornered, and their bites carry a cocktail of infections that would
  make a pre-war doctor weep.

  They're everywhere in The Scrap. The sound of tiny claws on metal is
  the wasteland's white noise.

encounter_notes: |
  Rust Rats are the tutorial enemy of Aftermath. They teach new players
  about swarm mechanics and the value of area attacks.

  Combat tactics:
  - Attack in groups, exploiting Swarm Instinct for bonus damage
  - Target food supplies to create urgency
  - Use tight spaces to ambush from unexpected angles
  - Scatter when losses mount

  Counters:
  - Fire damage kills them quickly
  - Area attacks break up swarms
  - Blocking ventilation shafts prevents ambushes
  - Loud noises can trigger early Scatter
