  Once a domestic dog, now something else entirely. Scorch Hounds are
  lean, hairless canines with cracked, blackened skin that glows with
  internal heat. Their eyes are embers. Their breath steams. When they
  bark, sparks fly from their mouths. Radiation and decades of mutation
  have turned their metabolism into a furnace — they run hot enough to
  leave scorched paw prints on concrete.

  They hunt in packs of 3-6, using coordinated tactics that suggest an
  intelligence their ancestors lacked. Scorch Hound packs claim territory
  along highways and ruins, attacking anything that enters. The only
  warning is the smell of burning ozone and the distant sound of baying
  that crackles like a campfire.

encounter_notes: |
  Scorch Hounds are the first real combat challenge in Aftermath. They
  teach players about pack tactics, elemental damage, and environmental
  hazards.

  Combat tactics:
  - Circle and flank, using Pack Howl to coordinate
  - One hound howls while others attack
  - Set environment on fire to create chokepoints
  - Focus fire on isolated targets

  Counters:
  - Cold damage bypasses resistance AND hits vulnerability
  - Staying grouped prevents flanking
  - Extinguishing fires removes their environmental advantage
  - Killing the howler disrupts coordination
