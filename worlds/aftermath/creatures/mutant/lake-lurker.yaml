  Something between a catfish and a nightmare. Lake Lurkers are massive
  amphibious creatures that inhabit the irradiated Great Lakes — six feet
  long, covered in armored scales that glow sickly green, with wide mouths
  full of needle teeth and two muscular forelimbs that let them drag
  themselves onto shore. Their eyes are milky white and oversized, adapted
  to the murky irradiated water.

  They're ambush predators. They lie just below the waterline, perfectly
  still, until something edible comes close. Then they lunge — fast,
  powerful, and surprisingly quiet for something that size. Fishers at
  The Lakeshore lose someone to the Lurkers every season.

encounter_notes: |
  Lake Lurkers are positional challenges. They're dangerous near water
  and manageable on dry land. They teach players to control the
  battlefield.

  Combat tactics:
  - Ambush from waterline with Lunge
  - Use Drag Under to isolate melee fighters
  - Retreat to water when wounded to heal
  - Toxic Slime punishes melee engagement

  Counters:
  - Fire and lightning bypass resistances
  - Fighting on dry land removes most advantages
  - Ranged attacks avoid Toxic Slime
  - Destroying nearby water sources (rare) eliminates retreat
