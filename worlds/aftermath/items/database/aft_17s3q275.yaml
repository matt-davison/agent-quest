description: |
  A pre-war stiletto with a yellowed bone handle, its spring mechanism
  still snapping open with a satisfying click. The blade is pitted but
  holds an edge. Fleetwood's adoptive mother carried it for decades
  before passing it down. The handle is warm to the touch, always,
  like it remembers being alive.
