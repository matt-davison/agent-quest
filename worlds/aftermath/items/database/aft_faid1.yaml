description: |
  A red plastic box with a white cross, scratched but intact. Inside:
  bandages, antiseptic (expired), a splint, surgical tape, and a tiny
  bottle of pre-war painkillers that are absolutely still good. Standard
  wasteland first aid — won't fix everything, but it'll keep you moving.
