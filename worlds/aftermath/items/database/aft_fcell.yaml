description: |
  A cylindrical cell about the size of a D battery, containing a miniature
  fusion reaction stabilized by magnetic fields. The backbone of pre-war
  power infrastructure and the post-war economy. Watts — energy credits —
  are measured against these. A full cell powers a household for a week
  or a robot for a month. Handle with care; a cracked cell is a very small,
  very bad day.
