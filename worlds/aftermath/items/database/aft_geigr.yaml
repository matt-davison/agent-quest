description: |
  A handheld radiation detector in a yellow plastic housing, dented but
  functional. The needle swings across a dial marked in roentgens. Clicks
  faster as radiation increases — the sound that keeps wasteland scavengers
  alive. Pre-war manufacture, post-war necessity. The battery compartment
  has been modified to accept fusion cells.
