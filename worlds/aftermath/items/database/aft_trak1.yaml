  A wrist-mounted device resembling a chunky digital watch crossed with a
  walkie-talkie. The screen is a tiny CRT — green phosphor text on black.

  AI systems. This one was found in ARC-7's supply closet, still in its
  original packaging. The manual is missing, but the device powers on when
  you strap it to your wrist, and the screen displays: "SEARCHING FOR
  CONDUCTOR SIGNAL..."
