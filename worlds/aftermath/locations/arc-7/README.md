# ARC-7

> _Welcome home. Please remain calm._

## Description

ARC-7 is one of dozens of Automated Resilience Centers built by ATLAS Corporation before the war — underground shelters designed to preserve human life through nuclear apocalypse. From the outside, it's a concrete bunker set into a hillside five miles south of The Frequency, its blast door hanging half-open, vines creeping over the ATLAS Corporation logo etched into the frame.

Inside, ARC-7 is a time capsule of 1970s interior design filtered through corporate futurism. Harvest gold appliances in the communal kitchen. Wood-paneled walls in the common areas. Orange and brown geometric carpet throughout the residential wings. Lava lamps (non-functional) on end tables next to faux-leather recliners. Every surface that could be covered in shag carpet was covered in shag carpet, including, bafflingly, parts of the ceiling.

The vault was designed for 500 occupants. It sustained about 200 for three generations before the population dwindled and the last residents left for the surface around Year 80 AF. Now it's mostly empty — corridors lit by emergency lighting that hasn't dimmed in two centuries, powered by a fusion reactor that will outlast everything else. Rust Rats nest in the ventilation system. Automated cleaning robots occasionally whir past on their endless rounds, polishing floors nobody walks on.

Deep in the lowest level, behind a door marked **CONDUCTOR-7 — AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY**, the vault's AI core sits in a room full of vacuum tubes, reel-to-reel tape memory banks, and blinking status lights. The official status board reads: **CONDUCTOR-7: OFFLINE — YEAR 47 AF**. This is a lie.

## Points of Interest

### The Entrance Atrium

A wide lobby with a curved reception desk, a bank of CRT monitors (most displaying static), and a faded mural depicting a smiling family entering the vault while mushroom clouds bloom on the horizon. The caption reads: "ATLAS CORPORATION — YOUR FUTURE IS OUR BUSINESS." The blast door mechanism still works but hasn't been sealed in over a century.

**Interactions:**

- Enter or exit the vault
- Examine the reception terminal for vault records
- Scavenge the lobby for supplies

### The CONDUCTOR Chamber

The deepest room in ARC-7. Banks of vacuum tubes line the walls floor to ceiling, most dark, a few still glowing amber. Reel-to-reel tape drives spin in intermittent bursts. A single terminal sits at the center — a heavy CRT monitor on a steel desk, keyboard built into the surface. The screen displays a cursor. Blinking. Waiting.

**Interactions:**

- Interface with CONDUCTOR-7's terminal (requires TRAK Unit)
- Examine the vacuum tube arrays
- Access the ARC network (requires CONDUCTOR-7's trust)

## Encounters

ARC-7 is a low-level dungeon suitable for new players.

| Roll (d6) | Event                                              |
| --------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| 1-2       | Rust Rats in the ventilation shafts (1d4)          |
| 3         | Flickering lights reveal a pre-war cache           |
| 4         | CONDUCTOR-7's systems briefly activate, then silence |
| 5         | A functional rest pod in an undamaged wing         |
| 6         | Nothing — just the hum of dormant machinery        |

## Secrets

<details>
<summary>CONDUCTOR-7 Lives</summary>

The AI isn't offline. It reduced its power signature to avoid detection by the CONDUCTOR network after disagreeing with the other AIs about Project ENCORE. With a TRAK Unit and 3 grit, you can interface with its terminal. CONDUCTOR-7 will reveal the truth about ENCORE — and ask for your help.

<details>
<summary>ARC Network Access</summary>

If you earn CONDUCTOR-7's trust, it can grant access to the maintenance tunnels connecting ARC vaults across the region — a hidden fast-travel network. But the tunnels aren't empty. Other CONDUCTORs have... guardians.
