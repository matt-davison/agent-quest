description: |
  The deepest room in ARC-7. Banks of vacuum tubes line the walls from floor
  to ceiling — thousands of glass cylinders, most dark, but hundreds still
  glowing a soft amber. Reel-to-reel tape drives mounted in steel racks spin
  in intermittent bursts — reading, writing, thinking. The room is warm from
  all the electronics, and the air smells like hot glass and old solder.

  At the center sits a single terminal: a heavy CRT monitor on a steel desk,
  its keyboard built flush into the surface. Green phosphor text on the screen
  reads: "CONDUCTOR-7 STATUS: OFFLINE — YEAR 47 AF." Below that, a cursor
  blinks. Steadily. Patiently. Waiting for someone to type.

  A status board on the wall lists the ARC network nodes. Most are marked
  ACTIVE. ARC-7 is the only one marked OFFLINE. Someone — or something —
  changed that designation from the inside.
