  A wide lobby with a curved reception desk and a bank of CRT monitors, most
  displaying static. A faded mural covers the back wall — a smiling family
  walking through vault doors while mushroom clouds bloom on the horizon. The
  caption reads: "ATLAS CORPORATION — YOUR FUTURE IS OUR BUSINESS." The blast
  door mechanism still works but hasn't been sealed in over a century. Harvest
  gold carpet, water-stained and matted, covers the floor. Emergency lighting
  casts everything in a dim amber glow. A cleaning robot occasionally whirs
  past, polishing a section of floor that hasn't seen a footprint in decades.
