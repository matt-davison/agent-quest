# The Frequency

> _Stay on the dial._

## Description

The Frequency sits inside the gutted shell of WSCR-FM, a pre-war radio station perched on a ridge overlooking miles of rusted factories and crumbling suburbs. The broadcast tower still stands — 300 feet of latticed steel crowned with blinking red lights, visible for miles across The Scrap. It's the first thing travelers see, and the last thing raiders want to mess with.

The station itself has been expanded over decades. Concrete walls reinforced with car doors and sheet metal. Windows replaced with welded-shut plates punched through with gun ports. The original lobby — all wood paneling and orange shag carpet, somehow preserved — serves as the settlement's common area. A hand-painted sign over the entrance reads: **WELCOME TO THE FREQUENCY — YOU'RE ON THE AIR**.

Inside, the air smells like solder, engine grease, and whatever Preacher Watts is cooking. Vacuum tube radios crackle from every corner, picking up broadcasts from settlements across The Scrap. The jukebox in the Rec Room still works, loaded with 45s that survived the bombs. Somewhere, Switchboard Sally is talking into a microphone, her voice reaching hundreds of listeners across the wasteland.

## Points of Interest

### The Broadcast Tower

The heart of The Frequency and Sally's domain. The top floor of the old station houses a working radio studio — reel-to-reel tape decks, analog mixing boards, a wall of vacuum tube amplifiers, and a microphone that's been broadcasting since Year 12 AF. Sally runs The Broadcast from here, coordinating settlements, warning of raider attacks, and playing the occasional Groove hymn for Preacher Watts.

**Interactions:**

- Speak with Switchboard Sally for quests and world news
- Listen to incoming broadcasts for rumors
- Access the signal map to learn about distant locations

### The Trading Floor

The station's old garage, now converted into a marketplace. Sparky — a pre-war maintenance robot with a CRT monitor for a face — runs the general store from behind a counter made of stacked engine blocks. Scavengers spread their finds on blankets. A hand-cranked scale sits next to a Geiger counter for checking goods.

**Interactions:**

- Buy and sell equipment at Sparky's General
- Trade with visiting scavengers
- Check the bounty board for salvage requests

### The Rec Room

The original station lounge, miraculously preserved. Brown leather couches with cigarette burns. A working jukebox stacked with 45 RPM records. Wood-paneled walls covered in faded concert posters and Polaroids of people who died two centuries ago. Preacher Watts holds court here, dispensing philosophy, home-brewed moonshine, and the occasional psychic vision.

**Interactions:**

- Rest to restore HP (5 watts/night)
- Listen to Preacher Watts for lore and rumors
- Play the jukebox (various effects)
- Meet other travelers

### The Bulletin Board

A cork board in the main hallway, bristling with handwritten notes, bounties, and requests. Sally curates it, but anyone can pin a job.

**Interactions:**

- Accept available quests
- Post bounties (high level)
- Read settlement news

### The Workshop

A cluttered garage bay with workbenches, welding equipment, and a pit for vehicle repairs. Travelers can maintain gear, learn basic crafting, and train with improvised weapons.

**Interactions:**

- Train abilities (costs watts)
- Repair damaged equipment
- Learn crafting recipes

## Secrets

<details>
<summary>CONDUCTOR-7's Signal</summary>

With a TRAK Unit, tune to frequency 107.7 FM near the broadcast tower. Through the static, a synthetic voice speaks — CONDUCTOR-7, the AI of ARC-7, isn't as offline as everyone believes. It has been listening. It has opinions about Project ENCORE.

<details>
<summary>Sally's Locked Studio</summary>

Reach standing 5 with Sally and ask about "the old recordings." She'll unlock the archive room — reels of pre-war broadcasts, government emergency transmissions, and one recording that might be the voice of an ATLAS Corporation executive explaining exactly what ENCORE was designed to do.
