description: |
  The top floor of WSCR-FM, converted into a working radio studio. Reel-to-reel
  tape decks line the walls, their spindles turning slowly. A massive analog
  mixing board — all chrome knobs and VU meters — dominates the center of the
  room. Behind a glass partition, Switchboard Sally sits at the microphone,
  headphones on, surrounded by a constellation of blinking vacuum tube amplifiers.
  A hand-drawn map of The Scrap covers one wall, pins and string connecting
  every known settlement. The broadcast tower itself rises through the ceiling,
  its latticed steel groaning softly in the wind.
