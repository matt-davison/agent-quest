description: |
  A stretch of hallway between the trading floor and the rec room, dominated
  by an enormous cork board that covers the entire wall. Handwritten notes,
  wanted posters, salvage requests, and settlement bulletins are pinned in
  overlapping layers — some fresh, some yellowed and curling. Sally curates it
  weekly, pulling down expired postings and pinning up new ones she's received
  over the radio. A jar of thumbtacks and a stack of blank index cards sit on
  a shelf below. A hand-lettered sign reads: "POST YOUR OWN — SALLY APPROVES
  ALL LISTINGS."
