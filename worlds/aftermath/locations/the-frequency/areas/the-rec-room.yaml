  The original WSCR-FM employee lounge, miraculously preserved. Brown leather
  couches cratered with cigarette burns sink into orange shag carpet that
  somehow survived nuclear war. Wood-paneled walls are covered in faded concert
  posters — Parliament-Funkadelic, Earth, Wind & Fire, Stevie Wonder — and
  Polaroids of DJs who died two centuries ago, still smiling. A working Wurlitzer
  jukebox stands in the corner, loaded with 45 RPM records. Its chrome curves
  catch the light from a genuine lava lamp on the bar.

  Preacher Watts sits in a massive armchair, his luminescent skin casting a
  faint blue glow. He serves moonshine from a repurposed chemistry set and
  dispenses philosophy to anyone who'll listen.
