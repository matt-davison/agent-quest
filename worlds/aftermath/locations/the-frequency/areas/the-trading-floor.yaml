  The station's old garage bay, converted into a marketplace. Sparky — a squat
  pre-war maintenance robot running on treads — operates from behind a counter
  made of stacked engine blocks. Its CRT monitor face cycles through emoticons:
  :-) when a customer approaches, :-$ during price negotiations, >:-( if you
  try to shoplift. Scavengers spread their finds on oil-stained blankets.
  A hand-cranked scale sits next to a clicking Geiger counter. Shelves of
  salvaged goods line the concrete walls — canned food, ammunition, duct tape,
  and the occasional pre-war curiosity that nobody can identify but everyone
  wants to buy.
