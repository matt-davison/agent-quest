  A cluttered garage bay with roll-up doors that open onto the settlement's
  perimeter. Workbenches line the walls — covered in vises, soldering irons,
  hand tools, and half-finished projects. A vehicle pit takes up the center,
  currently occupied by the rusted skeleton of a '72 Charger that someone's
  been restoring for years. Welding masks hang from hooks. A chalkboard lists
  available training courses in barely legible handwriting. The back wall is a
  pegboard of organized tools — wrenches, hammers, screwdrivers — each one
  outlined in marker so you know where it goes back.
