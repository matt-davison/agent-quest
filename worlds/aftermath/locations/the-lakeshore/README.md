# The Lakeshore

> _Don't drink the water._

## Description

The Lakeshore is a ramshackle fishing settlement built on the muddy banks of what used to be Lake Erie. The water glows faintly green at night — not enough radiation to kill you quickly, but enough to make the fish grow to unusual sizes and develop unusual temperaments. The settlement is a collection of shacks built from shipping containers, boat hulls, and driftwood, connected by boardwalks that creak over the mud.

The fishers here are tough, quiet people. They go out on the lake in welded-together boats, haul in mutant catfish the size of small cars, and trade the irradiated meat to settlements across The Scrap. It's not glamorous work. Nobody writes songs about it. But it feeds people, and in the aftermath, that's enough.

The docks are the center of settlement life. Boats come and go. Traders from The Frequency and The Millworks haggle over barrels of salted fish. A hand-painted sign on the dock house reads: "LAKE ERIE FISHING CO-OP — EST. YEAR 34 AF — NO SWIMMING." The warning isn't about modesty. It's about the Lake Lurkers.

## Points of Interest

### The Docks

A series of wooden and metal piers extending into the glowing lake. Fishing boats of various sizes and states of repair are moored here. Nets hang drying on racks. A dock house serves as the co-op's headquarters and trading post. Barrels of salted and smoked fish are stacked for trade. The smell is... powerful.

**Interactions:**

- Trade fish and salvage
- Hire a boat for lake exploration
- Speak with fishers for rumors and quests

## Secrets

<details>
<summary>The Sunken ARC</summary>

Talk to the old fishers about "lights under the water." They'll tell you about a structure visible on calm nights — the top of a sunken ARC vault, partially submerged when the lakeshore shifted after the bombs. Nobody's been down there. Nobody wants to. But the lights still blink.
