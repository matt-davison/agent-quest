  A series of wooden and metal piers jutting into the faintly glowing lake.
  Fishing boats of wildly different construction — welded oil drums, repurposed
  aluminum canoes, one genuine pre-war pontoon boat held together with prayers
  and duct tape — rock gently in the irradiated surf. Nets hang drying on
  racks made of rebar. The dock house is a shipping container with windows
  cut into it, serving as the co-op's trading post. Barrels of salted fish
  are stacked on every flat surface. Seagulls the size of turkeys circle
  overhead, waiting for scraps. The smell is extraordinary.
