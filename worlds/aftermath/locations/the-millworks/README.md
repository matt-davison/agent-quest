# The Millworks

> _Built to last. Built to fight._

## Description

The Millworks is a sprawling industrial complex — three square miles of factories, foundries, and warehouses that once produced everything from automobiles to ammunition. The largest buildings are brutalist concrete megastructures, their smokestacks still belching smoke from fusion-powered furnaces that never stopped running. The Millworkers' Union claimed the complex around Year 40 AF and has been manufacturing ever since.

The complex is fortified. Walls of stacked shipping containers and welded steel plate surround the perimeter. Guard towers made from crane cabs sit at every corner, manned by Union soldiers in heavy scrap armor. Inside, the streets between factories bustle with workers, traders, and the constant sound of industry — hammering, welding, the rhythmic thump of presses stamping out parts.

The Millworks produces most of the manufactured goods in The Scrap. Weapons, armor, tools, vehicle parts — if it's metal and it's new, it probably came from here. The Union trades these goods to settlements in exchange for food, fusion cells, and raw materials. They don't give anything away for free. Union rates. Union rules. Union town.

## Points of Interest

### The Union Hall

A converted factory floor turned into the seat of Union government. The floor boss's office overlooks the hall from a steel mezzanine. Banners displaying the Union's gear-and-hammer logo hang from the rafters. A massive chalkboard tracks production quotas, trade agreements, and defense schedules. Workers gather here for meetings, disputes, and the weekly allocation of rations and pay.
