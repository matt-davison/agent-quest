description: |
  A cavernous factory floor converted into the seat of Union government. The
  ceiling soars forty feet overhead, criss-crossed with steel I-beams from
  which Union banners — gear and hammer on a red field — hang like medieval
  tapestries. The floor boss's office sits on a steel mezzanine overlooking
  the hall. Below, rows of wooden benches face a raised platform where Union
  leaders address the workers. A massive chalkboard tracks production quotas,
  trade agreements, and defense schedules. The air smells like machine oil
  and chalk dust. Workers in coveralls and hard hats move with purpose.
