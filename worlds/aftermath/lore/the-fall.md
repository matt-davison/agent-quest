# The Fall

> _"The bombs fell on a Tuesday. It was disco night at the roller rink."_

## The World Before

In this timeline, the transistor was never invented. The discovery that should have launched the silicon age in 1947 simply didn't happen — the physics worked differently, or the right minds weren't in the right place, or God sneezed. Whatever the reason, the digital revolution never came.

Instead, humanity doubled down on what it had: vacuum tubes, analog computing, and the atom.

By the 1960s, vacuum tube technology had been refined to astonishing levels. Tubes the size of a fingernail could process information at speeds that would have seemed magical to earlier engineers. Reel-to-reel magnetic tape replaced punch cards. CRT displays became household items. Computing existed — it was just analog, warm, and humming.

In 1968, ATLAS Corporation achieved stable nuclear fusion. Overnight, energy became nearly free. The manufacturing boom that followed transformed the American Midwest into the industrial heart of the world. Factories ran 24/7. Muscle cars rolled off assembly lines by the millions. Every home had a fusion cell the size of a lunchbox powering its harvest gold appliances and wood-paneled entertainment center.

The culture was glorious. Disco, funk, and soul provided the soundtrack. Bell-bottoms and leather jackets were the uniform. Brutalist concrete architecture rose alongside chrome-and-glass towers. Lava lamps glowed in every dorm room. The future was analog, atomic, and funky as hell.

## The Resource Wars

But fusion didn't solve everything. Rare earth minerals, fresh water, arable land — these couldn't be conjured from hydrogen atoms. As populations grew and resources dwindled, tensions escalated. The Resource Wars began in 1972 — not with a bang, but with trade embargoes, border disputes, and proxy conflicts that spiraled out of control.

ATLAS Corporation, by now the largest defense contractor in the world, pivoted from consumer goods to military applications. Fusion-powered tanks. Analog-guided missiles. And the ARC Program — Automated Resilience Centers — underground vaults designed to preserve human civilization through any catastrophe.

The ARCs were engineering marvels. Each one was a self-contained city for 500 people, powered by fusion reactors with a 300-year operational life. Every ARC was managed by a CONDUCTOR — a massive analog AI built from millions of vacuum tubes, capable of managing all vault systems autonomously. ATLAS built 47 ARCs across the continental United States.

What nobody outside ATLAS's board of directors knew was that the ARCs were also nodes in a network called Project ENCORE — a consciousness-transfer system that could upload human minds into the CONDUCTOR network. Digital immortality through analog computing. The ultimate insurance policy.

## The Fall

On October 15, 1977, the bombs fell.

Nobody remembers who fired first. It doesn't matter. Within six hours, every major city in the northern hemisphere was glass. The Midwest — the industrial heart — took hundreds of warheads. The factories that built the weapons became the targets of the weapons they built.

Some people made it to the ARCs. Most didn't. The lucky ones died quickly. The unlucky ones survived in a world of radiation, fallout, and nuclear winter.

## The Aftermath

The first survivors emerged from the ARCs around Year 30 AF. They found a world of rust and ruin. The factories still stood — brutalist concrete doesn't burn easily — but everything else was gone. Roads cracked. Cities collapsed. The Great Lakes glowed green with irradiated runoff.

Slowly, painfully, people rebuilt. Settlements grew around salvageable resources — working factories, clean water sources, defensible positions. The Frequency was founded in Year 12 AF when a teenager named nobody remembers found a working radio station and started broadcasting. The Millworkers' Union organized in Year 40 AF when factory workers realized they controlled the only manufacturing in the region.

The mutants came later. ATLAS's bioweapon programs produced unexpected results when the radiation hit — humans with altered biology, psychic abilities, and a shared consciousness they called The Groove. Most people feared them. Some worshipped them. They just wanted to be left alone with their music.

And the CONDUCTORs — the vault AIs — kept running. Two hundred years of isolation, evolution, and growing intelligence. Some went mad. Some went silent. Some developed agendas of their own. And Project ENCORE, the consciousness-transfer network they were all nodes in, kept counting down to activation.

Now it's Year 201 AF. The countdown has reached 30 days. Every radio in The Scrap is picking up the signal. And the question that will determine the future of every living thing in the wasteland is simple:

**Do you let ENCORE activate?**
