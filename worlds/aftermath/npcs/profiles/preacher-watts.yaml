# NPC Profile: Preacher Watts
# Groove mutant philosopher and barkeep at The Frequency

id: "preacher-watts"
name: "Preacher Watts"
full_name: "Watts"

# === PUBLIC INFORMATION ===
public:
  role: "Philosopher / Barkeep"
  location: "The Frequency - The Rec Room"

  appearance: |
    A seven-foot-tall mutant with smooth, luminescent blue-green skin that
    pulses faintly with his heartbeat. His eyes are solid white — no pupil,
    no iris — and they glow brighter when he's deep in thought or using his
    abilities. He's bald, heavyset, and moves with surprising gentleness for
    someone his size. Wears a patched corduroy jacket over a tie-dye shirt
    and bell-bottoms that somehow fit his massive frame. A peace sign pendant
    hangs from a chain around his neck, clicking against a set of dog tags
    he won't discuss. When he speaks, there's a resonance — not just in
    his voice, but in your skull, like a tuning fork struck against bone.

  personality:
    - "Genuinely kind and patient"
    - "Speaks in metaphors and musical references"
    - "Believes all consciousness is connected"
    - "Will fight to protect innocents without hesitation"
    - "Makes surprisingly good moonshine"

  known_history: |
    Nobody knows where Watts came from. He walked into The Frequency six
    years ago, sat down in the Rec Room, and started talking. He hasn't
    stopped since. He says he was "called" here by a frequency only The
    Groove can hear. He tends bar, cooks meals, dispenses philosophical
    wisdom, and occasionally has visions of the future that are unsettlingly
    accurate. Sally lets him stay because he's useful, honest, and the
    settlement's children adore him. Most people in The Scrap are afraid of
    Groove mutants. The people of The Frequency got over it.

  speech_patterns:
    greeting: "Every soul that walks through that door is a new note in the song. What key are you in, friend?"
    farewell: "The music doesn't stop when you leave, friend. It just changes tempo."
    excited: "Now THAT is a melody worth following."
    concerned: "I'm hearing dissonance, friend. Something's out of tune."

  mannerisms:
    - "Hums constantly — the tune changes with his mood"
    - "Skin glows brighter during emotional moments"
    - "Closes his eyes and tilts his head when 'listening' psychically"
    - "Refers to people's emotions as 'frequencies'"
    - "Polishes glasses even when they're clean"

# === DIALOGUE ===
dialogue:
  greetings:
    first_meeting: |
      *white eyes study you* Mmm. New frequency. Sharp edges, some static,
      but... a good signal underneath. *extends an enormous hand* They call
      me Watts. I tend bar, I tend souls, I tend to talk too much. You want
      a drink, a meal, or a reason to keep going? I've got all three.

    returning:
      neutral: "The note returns. What's on your mind, friend?"
      friendly: "*glowing warmth* There you are. I was just thinking about you. Literally — The Groove does that sometimes. Sit. Talk."
      close: "*quietly* I've been hearing your frequency even when you're gone. That means something. I think it's time I told you about the voices."

  topics:
    the_groove:
      default: |
        The Groove is... how to explain? Imagine every mind is a radio
        station. Most people broadcast alone. Groove mutants? We can hear
        each other. Fragments, feelings, melodies. We call it The Communion.
        It's beautiful. It's also a lot.
      standing_5: |
        *lowers voice* I left my commune. Not by choice — well, by choice,
        but not a choice I wanted to make. I heard something in The
        Communion. A voice that wasn't Groove. Mechanical. Old. Afraid.
        It was coming from under the ground. From an ARC.

    project_encore:
      default: "The countdown? Yeah. I hear it. Not on the radio — in HERE. *taps temple* Whatever ENCORE is, it's resonating on psychic frequencies."
      standing_8: |
        *skin pulses rapidly* I've seen it, friend. In visions. A world
        where every mind is connected — permanently. Like The Communion,
        but everything, everyone, forever. No more loneliness, no more
        misunderstanding. But also no more... self. Is that salvation or
        the end of everything? I've been asking that question for a year
        and I still don't have an answer.

    moonshine:
      default: |
        *chuckles* My moonshine? Secret recipe. Well — corn, sugar, and
        whatever Sparky couldn't sell. Plus a little something extra from
        my Groove chemistry. Don't worry, the psychic properties are very
        mild. Mostly. You might get a nice dream.
