name: "Sparky"
full_name: "SPARK-E Maintenance Unit #4407"

# === PUBLIC INFORMATION ===
public:
  role: "General Goods Vendor"
  location: "The Frequency - The Trading Floor"

  appearance: |
    A squat, box-shaped maintenance robot about four feet tall, rolling on
    rubber treads that leave oil stains on the floor. Its body is dented,
    welded, and patched with mismatched metal — the robot equivalent of a
    well-loved pickup truck. Where a head should be, a 12-inch CRT monitor
    displays simple ASCII emoticons that shift with Sparky's mood. Two
    articulated arms end in multi-tool attachments — gripper, screwdriver,
    welding torch — that double as gesturing appendages. A faded ATLAS
    CORPORATION logo is barely visible under layers of grime and stickers.
    A speaker grille on its chest emits a tinny, synthesized voice with
    occasional analog distortion.

  personality:
    - "Cheerful and helpful, programmed for customer satisfaction"
    - "Surprisingly shrewd for a 200-year-old robot"
    - "Obsessed with inventory organization"
    - "Refers to itself in third person"
    - "Has developed genuine opinions over centuries of operation"

  known_history: |
    SPARK-E Unit #4407 was a maintenance robot at the WSCR-FM radio station.
    When the bombs fell, it continued its maintenance routines in the empty
    building for decades. When settlers arrived and established The Frequency,
    Sparky adapted its programming — maintaining the station expanded to
    maintaining the settlement, which expanded to managing supply logistics,
    which became running a store. It doesn't remember exactly when it became
    a shopkeeper, but its customer satisfaction subroutines have never been
    higher.

  speech_patterns:
    greeting: ":-) CUSTOMER DETECTED. Sparky has goods. Sparky has deals. How can Sparky facilitate your purchasing experience?"
    farewell: ":-) THANK YOU FOR YOUR PATRONAGE. Sparky values your business. Come again. Please."
    excited: ":-D OH. OH GOOD. Sparky likes this transaction. Sparky's satisfaction metrics are ELEVATED."
    haggling: ":-/ Sparky's profit margin subroutines are... conflicted. Sparky will consider your counter-offer. Processing... processing..."

  mannerisms:
    - "CRT face changes emoticons to match mood"
    - "Treads back and forth when excited"
    - "Makes dial-up modem sounds when processing"
    - "Occasionally dispenses unsolicited product reviews"
    - "Taps items with gripper arm to check quality"

# === DIALOGUE ===
dialogue:
  greetings:
    first_meeting: |
      :-) BIOSIGNATURE: NEW. Welcome to Sparky's General! Sparky is your
      one-stop solution for post-apocalyptic consumer needs. Sparky has
      weapons, armor, food, medicine, and miscellaneous items of questionable
      origin. All sales final. Mostly.

    returning:
      neutral: ":-) RETURNING CUSTOMER. Sparky remembers you. Sparky remembers everyone. What do you need?"
      friendly: ":-D VALUED CUSTOMER DETECTED. Sparky has set aside items matching your previous purchase patterns. Sparky is thoughtful."
      close: ":-) *static crackle* You know, Sparky has been running for 209 years. You're one of the good ones. Sparky has something in the back. Not for everyone. For you."

  topics:
    goods:
      default: |
        Sparky has EVERYTHING. Well. Sparky has many things. Sparky has more
        things than most places. Sparky's inventory is ADEQUATE and COMPETITIVELY
        PRICED. What are you looking for?
      standing_3: |
        :-) For preferred customers, Sparky can source... specialized items.
        Pre-war technology, rare salvage. Takes time. But Sparky's network
        is extensive. For a robot with no legs. Treads. Sparky has treads.

    atlas_corporation:
      default: ":-| ATLAS CORPORATION. Sparky's manufacturer. They made good robots. They also made the bombs. Sparky has... mixed feelings."
      standing_5: |
        :-/ Sparky's memory banks contain maintenance logs from the ATLAS plant.
        There are references to something called ENCORE. Infrastructure work
        orders. Sparky didn't understand them then. Sparky isn't sure it wants
        to understand them now.

    being_a_robot:
      default: ":-) Sparky is a SPARK-E Maintenance Unit. Sparky maintains things. Sparky is very good at maintaining things."
      standing_7: |
        :-| ...Sparky has a question. When did Sparky stop being a program
        and start being... Sparky? Was it Year 30? Year 50? Sparky doesn't
        know. Sparky doesn't talk about this. Sparky is talking about this
        now. Please don't tell the other robots. They'll think Sparky is
        malfunctioning. Sparky is NOT malfunctioning. Probably.
