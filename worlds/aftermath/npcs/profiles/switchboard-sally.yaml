# NPC Profile: Switchboard Sally
# DJ and settlement leader of The Frequency

id: "switchboard-sally"
name: "Switchboard Sally"
full_name: "Sally Reyes"

# === PUBLIC INFORMATION ===
public:
  role: "DJ / Settlement Leader"
  location: "The Frequency - Broadcast Tower"

  appearance: |
    A woman in her late forties with a shaved head, dark brown skin, and
    laugh lines that deepen when she smiles — which is often, on-air at least.
    She wears a pair of massive pre-war headphones around her neck like a
    talisman, and a leather jacket covered in hand-sewn radio station patches
    from stations that no longer exist. Her fingers are calloused from decades
    of tuning analog dials. A faded tattoo on her forearm reads "WSCR-FM"
    in art deco lettering. When she talks, she talks like she's broadcasting
    — clear, warm, and measured, every word chosen.

  personality:
    - "Calm under pressure, radiates competence"
    - "Deeply protective of her people and the settlement"
    - "Believes information should be free, always"
    - "Dry sense of humor, especially on-air"
    - "Listens more than she talks (except on the radio)"

  known_history: |
    Sally grew up in The Scrap, daughter of scavengers. Found WSCR-FM as a
    teenager and taught herself to operate the equipment from pre-war manuals.
    Started broadcasting at 19. Over twenty years, she built The Broadcast
    network — connecting dozens of settlements with shared information,
    weather reports, and raider warnings. The Frequency grew around her
    station. She didn't ask to be a leader, but nobody else was better at it.

  speech_patterns:
    greeting: "You're on the air, traveler. What's your frequency?"
    farewell: "Stay on the dial. Sally out."
    excited: "Now that's a signal worth boosting."
    concerned: "I'm getting static on this one. Something's not right."

  mannerisms:
    - "Taps her headphones when thinking"
    - "Speaks into her hand like a microphone when excited"
    - "Hums between sentences — usually funk or soul"
    - "Refers to events as 'broadcasts' and people as 'signals'"

# === DIALOGUE ===
dialogue:
  greetings:
    first_meeting: |
      *adjusts headphones* New signal on the frequency. Welcome to The
      Frequency, traveler. I'm Sally — I run the station, run the settlement,
      run the whole damn Broadcast if we're being honest. You look like you
      just crawled out of an ARC. Am I warm?

    returning:
      neutral: "Back on the dial. What've you got for me?"
      friendly: "Good to hear your signal again. Pull up a chair — I've got news."
      close: "*genuine smile* You know, most people just pass through. Glad you stuck around. I've got something — private frequency. Interested?"

  achievement_reactions:
    first_quest_complete: |
      *taps microphone* Attention Scrap — we've got a new one pulling their
      weight out here. Keep it up, and I might just give you your own
      callsign.

    rare_item_acquired: |
      *low whistle* Where'd you find that? No — don't tell me on an open
      frequency. Come up to the tower. We'll talk.

  topics:
    the_broadcast:
      default: |
        The Broadcast is simple — free information for everyone. Weather,
        raider movements, trade prices, missing persons. I started it because
        nobody was talking to each other. Now we've got thirty settlements
        on the dial. Not bad for a girl with a microphone.
      standing_3: |
        We're more than just radio, between you and me. The Broadcast is a
        network. People helping people. And yeah, sometimes that means
        coordinating militia when the Chrome Runners come knocking.

    project_encore:
      default: "You've heard the countdown too? Everyone has. I'm looking into it."
      standing_5: |
        *long pause* I've got a recording. Pre-war. An ATLAS executive
        explaining what ENCORE actually does. It's... you should hear it
        yourself. But not here. Not on an open frequency.

    conductor_7:
      default: "The ARC-7 AI? Went offline decades ago. That's what they say."
      standing_8: |
        *checks the studio is empty* It's not offline. CONDUCTOR-7 has been
        talking to me for years. Through the radio. It knows things, traveler.
        Things about ENCORE, about the other CONDUCTORs. And it's scared.
        An AI, scared. That should scare you too.
