backstory: |
  Fleetwood was never supposed to exist. Her parents were subjects in an
  ATLAS Corporation repopulation experiment deep inside ARC-7 — test-tube
  breeding stock for a post-apocalyptic future. Her mother died during
  childbirth and the scientists discarded the body outside the bunker like
  medical waste. An old wanderer named Cinder found the corpse with its
  belly still moving, cut Fleetwood free, and raised her on the road.
  Cinder taught her to read faces the way other children learn to read
  words — to see the lie behind the smile, the fear behind the anger.
  She taught her to take what she needed and give what she could. Now
  Cinder is gone, Fleetwood is grown, and she has come back to ARC-7
  to find the people who threw her mother away.

    detail: |
      The blast door hangs half-open like a mouth mid-scream. Fleetwood slides
      through sideways, Cinder's switchblade warm against her thigh, lockpicks
      riding her hip. The air inside tastes like recycled nothing — two hundred
      years of the same molecules breathing in and out of the same vents. Orange
      shag carpet under her boots. Emergency lighting painting everything the color
      of a dying sunset. She's spent her whole life hearing stories about this place.
      Now she's here. Somewhere in these corridors are the people — or the records
      of the people — who treated her mother like a disposable container.
