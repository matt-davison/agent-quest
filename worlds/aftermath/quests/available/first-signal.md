## Summary

You've emerged from ARC-7 into a world of rust, radiation, and radio. Find The Frequency, meet its people, and prove you can survive.

## Background

Every ARC dweller eventually leaves the vault. Some are pushed out by failing systems, others by curiosity, and a few by the quiet voice on frequency 107.7 that whispers "come to the tower." You're one of the lucky ones — ARC-7 is only five miles from The Frequency, the largest Broadcast settlement in The Scrap. But five miles in the wasteland is five miles of Rust Rats, Ferals, and worse. Make it to the tower, and Switchboard Sally will set you up. She sets everyone up. That's what The Broadcast does.

## Objectives

- [ ] Emerge from ARC-7's entrance
- [ ] Travel to The Frequency (south road, 2 hours)
- [ ] Speak with Switchboard Sally at the Broadcast Tower
- [ ] Visit Sparky's General on the Trading Floor
- [ ] Listen to Preacher Watts in the Rec Room
- [ ] Check the Bulletin Board for available jobs
- [ ] Return to Sally for your TRAK Unit

## Walkthrough

### Step 1: Leave ARC-7

The vault entrance is open. The blast door hasn't sealed in a century. Step through into daylight — harsh, grey, and filtered through permanent cloud cover. The air tastes like rust and ozone.

> *You squint against the light. The world outside ARC-7 is... bigger than the manuals described. A cracked highway leads north through ruins. In the distance, a red light blinks atop a radio tower.*

### Step 2: Travel to The Frequency

Follow the south road north toward the radio tower. The journey is 5 miles — about 2 hours on foot through light ruins. Watch for Rust Rats in the rubble.

> *The highway is cracked and overgrown. Rusted cars sit where they stopped 201 years ago. The radio tower grows closer, and with it, the sound of music — faint, crackling through a speaker somewhere. A sign ahead reads: "WELCOME TO THE FREQUENCY — YOU'RE ON THE AIR."*

### Step 3: Meet Switchboard Sally

Enter The Frequency and climb to the Broadcast Tower. Sally's on the air.

> **Sally:** *adjusts headphones* "New signal on the frequency. You look fresh — ARC-7? Yeah, I can tell. You've got that 'just saw the sun for the first time' look. Welcome to The Frequency, traveler. I'm Sally. I run The Broadcast — free information for everyone. News, weather, raider warnings. You need to know something? I probably already know it. But first, get yourself situated. Talk to Sparky downstairs for gear, visit Watts in the Rec Room for a hot meal, and check the bulletin board. Come back when you've got your bearings."

### Step 4: Visit Sparky

Head to the Trading Floor and speak with Sparky.

> **Sparky:** ":-) CUSTOMER DETECTED. Welcome to Sparky's General! You are new. Sparky can tell because you are staring at Sparky's face. Yes, it is a CRT monitor. Yes, Sparky is a robot. No, Sparky does not dream of electric sheep. Sparky dreams of INVENTORY OPTIMIZATION. How can Sparky help?"

Browse the shop. You start with 50 watts — enough for basic supplies.

### Step 5: Listen to Preacher Watts

Find Preacher Watts in the Rec Room.

> **Watts:** *white eyes study you* "Mmm. Fresh out of the ground. I can tell — your frequency is still... underground. Muffled. Give it time, friend. The wasteland has a way of tuning you. Sit down. Have some stew. It's not poisonous. Mostly." *He pauses, head tilted.* "You heard it too, didn't you? The countdown. Every radio in The Scrap is picking it up. 'Project ENCORE activates in 30 days.' Nobody knows what it means. But I've got a feeling it means everything."

### Step 6: Check the Bulletin Board

Read the postings on the bulletin board in the main hallway.

> *Handwritten notes, bounties, and requests cover the cork board. Most are mundane — "WANTED: Duct Tape, will trade canned peaches" — but a few catch your eye. Sally has pinned a priority notice at the top: "ENCORE COUNTDOWN: 30 DAYS. ALL SETTLEMENTS ON ALERT. INFORMATION WANTED."*

### Step 7: Return to Sally

Go back to the Broadcast Tower and report in.

> **Sally:** "Good. You've met the crew, you've seen the board, and you haven't run back to your vault screaming. That puts you ahead of most. Here —" *she opens a drawer and pulls out a chunky wrist device* "— this is a TRAK Unit. Terminal Remote Access Kit. Pre-war tech, lets you interface with CONDUCTOR systems. Every ARC has a CONDUCTOR — an AI that ran the vault. Most of them are still running. Including yours." *She pauses.* "ARC-7's CONDUCTOR went offline decades ago. Officially. But I've been picking up signals on 107.7 that say otherwise. Could be nothing. Could be something. Either way — welcome to The Scrap, traveler. Stay on the dial."
