# === CALENDAR OVERVIEW ===
calendar:
  name: "The Scrap Calendar"
  description: |
    Time in Aftermath is measured in years After the Fall (AF). The calendar
    was reconstructed by early survivors from pre-war almanacs. Twelve months,
    roughly aligned with the old calendar but renamed for wasteland life.
    Nobody remembers the original month names. Nobody cares.
