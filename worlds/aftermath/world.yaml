  The Scrap — ruins of the industrial Midwest, 201 years after nuclear war.
  The transistor was never invented. Analog computing, vacuum tubes, and nuclear
  fusion powered a manufacturing golden age until the Resource Wars ended it all
  in 1977. Now scavengers, mutants, rogue AIs, and would-be governments fight
  over what remains. Disco is eternal. The bombs were not.
