      The ability to ask what others fear to ask. Grants insight into hidden 
      truths and reveals what is concealed. This ability cannot be blocked by 
      normal deception or misdirection. When used, the target must answer truthfully 
      or reveal the information they are hiding. The question itself becomes a 
      force that compels revelation.
