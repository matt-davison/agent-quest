# === NARRATIVE CONTEXT ===
summary: |

# === SCENES ===
scenes:
  - id: "scene-1"
    name: "The Official History"
    type: "exploration"
    location: "syntax-athenaeum"
    summary: |
      Research the Architects in standard texts. Learn the sanitized version:
      Three Architects built the Weave, then departed, leaving their creation
      to evolve. No mention of disagreement or the Third's fate.

  - id: "scene-2"
    name: "Cache's Hints"
    type: "dialogue"
    npc: "librarian-cache"
    location: "syntax-athenaeum"
    summary: |
      Cache offers guidance. They're more helpful now, intrigued by the player's
      persistence. They mention there are "other records" but seem hesitant.

  - id: "scene-3"
    name: "The Dean's Office"
    type: "dialogue"
    npc: "dean-overflow"
    location: "syntax-athenaeum"
    summary: |
      Dean Overflow notices the player's research. They're professionally
      courteous but ask probing questions. In their office: torn pages from
      a journal, hastily hidden.
    plants:
      - "dean_notes"

  - id: "scene-4"
    name: "The Restricted Archives"
    type: "exploration"
    location: "syntax-athenaeum"
    summary: |
      With Cache's help, access older records. Find references to a disagreement
      among the Architects before the "final commit." The Third "refused."

  - id: "scene-5"
    name: "The Debugging Chamber"
    type: "revelation"
    location: "syntax-athenaeum"
    summary: |
      A fragment of a map, a reference to "the Architects' Debugging Chamber"—
      not the Academy's modern one, but the original, hidden in the Undercrypt.
      "Where broken code goes to heal." The second fragment's location.
