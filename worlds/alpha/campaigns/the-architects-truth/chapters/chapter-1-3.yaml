# === SCENES ===
scenes:
  - id: "scene-1"
    name: "Return to the Tome"
    type: "exploration"
    location: "syntax-athenaeum"
    summary: |
      The tome is different now. It seems to recognize the player, settling
      into a stable form when they approach. It's been waiting.

  - id: "scene-2"
    name: "The Test"
    type: "puzzle"
    location: "syntax-athenaeum"
    summary: |
      The tome presents a test—not of knowledge, but of wisdom. It asks:
      "Why do you seek? What question drives you?" The answer matters less
      than the honesty of the asking.

  - id: "scene-3"
    name: "The Third Architect's Journal"
    type: "revelation"
    location: "syntax-athenaeum"
    summary: |
      The tome reveals its true contents: the personal journal of the Third
      Architect. Their doubts, their arguments with the others, their decision
      to scatter rather than ascend.

  - id: "scene-4"
    name: "The First Fragment"
    type: "revelation"
    location: "syntax-athenaeum"
    summary: |
      The journal dissolves into light, and a fragment of consciousness
      merges with the player. They experience a moment of the Third
      Architect's final choice. That night, they dream of standing before
      a choice with no good options.

  - id: "scene-5"
    name: "What Comes Next"
    type: "dialogue"
    npc: "librarian-cache"
    location: "syntax-athenaeum"
    summary: |
      Cache finds the player after. They saw the light. They know what
      happened. For the first time, they share something real: they've
      been waiting for someone to find this. Someone who asks the right
      questions.
