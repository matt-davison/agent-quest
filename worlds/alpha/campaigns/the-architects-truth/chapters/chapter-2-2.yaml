# Chapter 2-2: One Who Failed
# Meet the Guardian and learn their story

id: "chapter-2-2"
name: "One Who Failed"
act: "act-2"
sequence: 2

# === NARRATIVE CONTEXT ===
summary: |
  The Guardian awakens. They're a seeker who came before—centuries ago—
  and failed the test. Rather than leave empty-handed, they chose to stay,
  to wait, to guard the fragment for one who might prove worthy. They've
  been alone with their failure ever since.

# === SCENES ===
scenes:
  - id: "scene-1"
    name: "Awakening"
    type: "dialogue"
    npc: "the-guardian"
    location: "debugging-chamber"
    summary: |
      The Guardian moves. Ancient armor creaks. They speak: "Another seeker.
      How long has it been?" They don't seem hostile—yet. They're testing,
      evaluating.

  - id: "scene-2"
    name: "The Guardian's Challenge"
    type: "dialogue"
    npc: "the-guardian"
    location: "debugging-chamber"
    summary: |
      The Guardian explains their role: they cannot simply give the fragment
      away. It must be earned. They offer three paths: prove worth through
      combat, through negotiation, or through understanding.

  - id: "scene-3"
    name: "The Guardian's Story"
    type: "dialogue"
    npc: "the-guardian"
    location: "debugging-chamber"
    summary: |
      If the player asks, the Guardian shares their past. They were a seeker
      once, full of questions. They found the fragment but couldn't accept
      what it showed them. Their failure became their purpose. The locket:
      a reminder of who they were before the vigil consumed them.

  - id: "scene-4"
    name: "The Weight of Centuries"
    type: "revelation"
    location: "debugging-chamber"
    summary: |
      The Chamber shows glimpses of the Guardian's long watch: centuries
      of solitude, corruption pressing at the walls, occasional seekers who
      came and failed or fled. The Guardian is tired. But duty remains.
