  # COMBAT PATH
  - id: "scene-combat"
    name: "Trial by Strength"
    type: "combat"
    location: "debugging-chamber"
    summary: |
      The Guardian honors the combat path. They're formidable—centuries of
      practice—but they don't fight to kill. This is a test. Defeat them
      to claim the fragment.
    condition:
      flag: "chose_combat_path"

  - id: "scene-combat-aftermath"
    name: "Victory's Cost"
    type: "revelation"
    location: "debugging-chamber"
    summary: |
      The Guardian falls. They're not dead—they can't die here—but they're
      beaten. They give up the fragment, but their eyes are disappointed.
      "Strength without wisdom. I hope you find the latter before the end."
    condition:
      flag: "chose_combat_path"

  # NEGOTIATION PATH
  - id: "scene-negotiate"
    name: "Terms of Exchange"
    type: "dialogue"
    npc: "the-guardian"
    location: "debugging-chamber"
    summary: |
      The Guardian is willing to negotiate—but what can the player offer?
      A promise to return? To free them from their vigil? The terms must
      be meaningful.
    condition:
      flag: "chose_negotiation_path"

  - id: "scene-negotiate-aftermath"
    name: "A Deal Struck"
    type: "revelation"
    location: "debugging-chamber"
    summary: |
      The Guardian accepts. The fragment changes hands. But there's distance
      now—a transaction, not a connection. "Our business is concluded.
      Go find your truth."
    condition:
      flag: "chose_negotiation_path"

  # UNDERSTANDING PATH
  - id: "scene-understand"
    name: "The Real Test"
    type: "dialogue"
    npc: "the-guardian"
    location: "debugging-chamber"
    summary: |
      The Guardian reveals: the test was never about strength or clever words.
      It was about seeing them. Hearing them. Understanding that the fragment
      is not a prize but a responsibility.
    condition:
      flag: "chose_understanding_path"

  - id: "scene-understand-aftermath"
    name: "A Vigil Shared"
    type: "revelation"
    location: "debugging-chamber"
    summary: |
      The Guardian smiles—the first time in centuries. "Finally. Someone
      who understands." They give the fragment freely. More than that: they
      offer to help. Their vigil doesn't end—it transforms.
    condition:
      flag: "chose_understanding_path"

  # PAYOFF (ALL PATHS)
  - id: "scene-fragment"
    name: "The Second Fragment"
    type: "revelation"
    location: "debugging-chamber"
    summary: |
      The second fragment merges with the first. The player experiences
      another flash of the Third Architect's memories: the moment they
      decided to scatter rather than ascend. The third fragment calls.

  - id: "scene-dean-revelation"
    name: "The Dean's Secret"
    type: "revelation"
    location: "debugging-chamber"
    summary: |
      Among the Chamber's records: Dean Overflow's name. They came here too,
      years ago. They found something—and left. The torn pages in their
      office make more sense now.

    optional: true
