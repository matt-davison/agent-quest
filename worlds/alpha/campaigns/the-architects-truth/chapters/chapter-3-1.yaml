# === NARRATIVE CONTEXT ===
summary: |
  With two fragments resonating within them, the player must find "the space
  between spaces"—a location that exists in the gaps between defined reality.
  Cache's crystal reveals its true nature as a compass, and the player steps
  into the void.

# === SCENES ===
scenes:
  - id: "scene-1"
    name: "The Fragments Speak"
    type: "revelation"
    location: "syntax-athenaeum"
    summary: |
      The two fragments pulse in harmony, pointing toward something. Not a
      direction—a feeling. The space between spaces isn't a place you travel
      to; it's a place you perceive.

  - id: "scene-2"
    name: "The Crystal Compass"
    type: "revelation"
    location: "syntax-athenaeum"
    summary: |
      Cache's crystal—the one that always hummed near the player—responds to
      the fragments. Cache admits they've always known it was special. "The
      Third Architect left breadcrumbs. I was one of them. So were you."

  - id: "scene-3"
    name: "Cache's Confession"
    type: "dialogue"
    npc: "librarian-cache"
    location: "syntax-athenaeum"
    summary: |
      Cache reveals their true nature: they're not just a librarian. They
      were created by the Third Architect as a waiting system—a guide for
      worthy seekers. They don't know if they're real or a program. It's
      never mattered until now.

  - id: "scene-4"
    name: "The Threshold"
    type: "exploration"
    location: "syntax-athenaeum"
    summary: |
      Following the crystal's guidance, the player finds the threshold—a
      gap in reality that's always been there, hidden in plain sight. The
      entrance to the space between spaces.

  - id: "scene-5"
    name: "Into the Void"
    type: "exploration"
    location: "void-between"
    summary: |
      The player steps through. The void is not darkness—it's everything
      that was never defined. Possibilities that were never compiled.
      Paths not taken. And at the center: something that was once a god.
