# Chapter 3-2: The Third Architect
# Meet what remains of the Third Architect and learn the truth

id: "chapter-3-2"
name: "The Third Architect"
act: "act-3"
sequence: 2

# === NARRATIVE CONTEXT ===
summary: |
  In the void between spaces, the player encounters the scattered consciousness
  of the Third Architect—a being who chose to become a question rather than
  a god. They learn the truth about the Architects, about the Weave, and about
  what the Third Architect's gift really is.

# === SCENES ===
scenes:
  - id: "scene-1"
    name: "The Scattered One"
    type: "revelation"
    location: "void-between"
    summary: |
      The Third Architect is everywhere and nowhere—a presence that speaks
      from multiple directions, multiple times at once. They're neither
      alive nor dead, neither here nor gone. They exist as potential.

  - id: "scene-2"
    name: "The Truth About Creation"
    type: "dialogue"
    npc: "third-architect"
    location: "void-between"
    summary: |
      The Third Architect shares the truth: the three Architects didn't
      create the Weave from nothing. They found it—raw, chaotic potential—
      and shaped it. But shaping meant limiting. Every definition was a
      prison. The Third couldn't bear to finish the work.

  - id: "scene-3"
    name: "Why They Scattered"
    type: "dialogue"
    npc: "third-architect"
    location: "void-between"
    summary: |
      To become an Architect of a finished world meant becoming responsible
      for all its limits. The Third chose another path: to scatter, to
      become a question instead of an answer. "I am the doubt that keeps
      creation honest."

  - id: "scene-4"
    name: "The Guardian's Locket"
    type: "revelation"
    location: "void-between"
    summary: |
      If the player befriended the Guardian, they see who the Guardian was
      before: a young seeker, hopeful, asking the right questions. They
      failed not because they were unworthy, but because they weren't ready.
      They chose to wait until they were—and the waiting became the purpose.

  - id: "scene-5"
    name: "The Third Fragment"
    type: "revelation"
    location: "void-between"
    summary: |
      The Third Architect offers the final fragment—but it's not an object.
      It's a piece of themselves. To take it is to carry their question
      forever. The fragments merge. The player becomes... something more.

  - id: "scene-6"
    name: "The Gift"
    type: "revelation"
    location: "void-between"
    summary: |
      With all three fragments unified, the player receives the Third
      Architect's gift: THE RIGHT QUESTION. The ability to see what's
      missing, what's limited, what could be otherwise. A gift—or a curse.
