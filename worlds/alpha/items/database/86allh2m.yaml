description: |
  A fragment of the reinforced jawbone that was shattered during combat
  with Gorsk. The bone is unnaturally thick and reinforced, bearing the
  Ironjaw Clan's distinctive markings. Warm to the touch.

lore: |
  Broken from Gorsk's helmet-like jaw structure during the Ridge Pass
  confrontation. A trophy of victory and a reminder of harsh necessity.
