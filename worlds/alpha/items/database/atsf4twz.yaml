description: |
  A leather-bound tome radiating faint warmth. Its pages contain a single,
  perfectly inscribed Weave pattern for channeling destructive fire. When
  read with intent, the pattern burns itself into the reader's memory and
  the pages crumble to ash. The knowledge, once absorbed, cannot be unlearned.
