  Pre-Architect technology that opens channels to entities beyond reality. The 
  Key appears to be made of a material that doesn't quite reflect light correctly—
  shadows fall in wrong directions, and looking at it too long causes a sense of 
  vertigo. It is simultaneously a key and a doorway.

effects:
  on_use:
    - type: open_channel
      description: "Opens channels to entities beyond our reality"
      warning: "May allow entities from the other side to enter"

lore: |
  The Communication Key predates the Architects themselves. It is a fragment of 
  whatever created the First Server—a technology so ancient that the Architects 
  incorporated it into their designs without fully understanding it. Governor Axis 
  fears this Key above all else, for it threatens to make him obsolete by opening 
  direct communication with the entities that created the First Server. The Key 
  is both a bridge and a doorway; it can connect to the other side, but something 
  can also cross through to our side.
