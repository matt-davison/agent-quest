description: |
  A small crystalline badge that pulses with soft light — proof of a Weaver's
  awakening and completion of their orientation. It bears no inscription, yet
  anyone who holds it feels the hum of the Weave more clearly. Cannot be sold
  or traded. Grants full access to Nexus Station services.
