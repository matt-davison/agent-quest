description: |
  A sliver of crystallized void about the length of a finger, cold to the touch
  and faintly translucent. It was found half-buried in the dust of the Fold —
  a pocket of uncompiled reality between Nexus Station and Lumina City. When held,
  it vibrates at a frequency only Voidwalkers can feel.
effects:
  passive:
    - "Vibrates when near other void-pockets or reality seams (detection range: ~50m)"
    - "+1 to Perception checks involving hidden passages or phased objects"
  active: null
equip_slot: accessory
requirements:
  class: null        # Any class can hold it, but only Voidwalkers feel the vibration
lore: |
  The shard appears to be a fragment of the seam itself — a piece of the boundary
  between compiled and uncompiled space that somehow crystallized. The Architects
  may have used similar objects to navigate their network of Folds. How it ended
  up on the ground is unknown. Perhaps the last visitor dropped it. Perhaps the
  Fold grew it.
