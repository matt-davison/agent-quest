description: |
  A dark violet tome that feels heavier than it looks, as though it
  bends space around itself. The Weave pattern inside manipulates
  gravitational forces, pulling enemies toward a focal point. The
  technique requires a Tier 3 understanding of reality manipulation.
  Upon absorption, the tome implodes silently into a point of light.
