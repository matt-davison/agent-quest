  A small vial of glowing liquid that shifts between amber and violet. When 
  consumed, it sharpens perception to preternatural levels, allowing the user 
  to notice details invisible to normal sight. The taste is bittersweet with 
  a metallic aftertaste. Side effects may include mild temporal distortion.

lore: |
  Focus Serum is distilled from the neural patterns of deep-code divers—those 
  who spend extended periods in virtual environments. The Black Market moves 
  significant quantities of the serum, though the Neon Saints ensure only 
  approved dealers can trade it. Overuse can lead to permanent hyper-awareness, 
  a condition where the user cannot stop noticing every detail, every pattern, 
  every sound—a form of madness that consumes from within.
