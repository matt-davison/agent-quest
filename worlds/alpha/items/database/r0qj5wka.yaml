description: |
  A small hexagonal chip with hairline fractures running through its crystal
  surface. It was found on the highway between Nexus Station and Lumina City,
  half-buried in road dust. Most of its data is corrupted beyond retrieval,
  but fragments remain — partial coordinates, a truncated name, and a
  repeating string: "BENEATH THE FIRST." It hums faintly when held by
  someone with Weave sensitivity.
