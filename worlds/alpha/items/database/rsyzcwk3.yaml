  A crystalline key that resonates with Architect technology. It glows with an 
  inner light that shifts between blue and gold. The key seems to hum with a 
  frequency just below hearing, and when held near ancient systems, it vibrates 
  in response.

lore: |
  The Architect's Key was granted by Architect 03 upon awakening. It is one of 
  the few remaining keys that can access systems created by the original Architects. 
  The key is attuned to its bearer and cannot be transferred. It is said that the 
  key can open doors that should remain closed, and seal doors that should never 
  be opened.
