tier: 1  # Open to all levels, but higher tiers unlock deadlier matches

description: |
  Rising from Lumina City's entertainment district like a second sun, the Chromedome
  is a colossal hemisphere of mirrored chrome that catches every light in the city
  and scatters it back as pure spectacle. On fight nights, you can see it from
  anywhere in the Midstreets — a beacon of violence and glory.

  Inside, fifty thousand seats rise in concentric rings around the Arena Floor — a
  marvel of techno-magical engineering that can transform mid-battle into jungle,
  glacier, volcano, or void. Champions have risen here. Legends have fallen. And
  the crowd always, always, demands more.

  "Where legends are forged in light."

atmosphere:
  lighting: "Blinding spotlights, holographic effects, chrome reflections everywhere"
  sounds: "Roaring crowds, dramatic announcers, combat impacts, monster roars"
  smells: "Sweat, ozone, synthetic fog, expensive perfume from the VIP sections"

# === THE ARENA FLOOR ===

  description: |
    The heart of the Chromedome — a 100-meter diameter platform of smart-matter
    that can reshape itself on command. One moment it's flat steel, the next it's
    a forest of crystal spires or a lake of liquid fire.

# === SECRETS ===
secrets:
  - id: "fixed_fights"

    discovery_method: "Befriend The Fix, complete underground quest"
    content: |
      Some championship matches are predetermined. Corporate interests,
      political favors, ancient debts. The Pit Boss knows. He doesn't approve,
      but some powers are beyond even him.

      The Render — the arena's most terrifying monster — wasn't captured.
      It was found here, dormant, when they built the Chromedome. The arena
      was constructed specifically to contain it. To study it. To profit from it.

    discovery_method: "Challenge Seraph, survive 10 rounds"
    content: |
      Seraph made a deal with a Glitch — a sentient error in reality's code.
