name: "The Jade Dragon"
parent_location: "lumina-city"
type: "restaurant"
tier: 1

description: |
  A three-story establishment where east meets west meets something older.
  The ground floor is a bustling restaurant serving fusion cuisine — dumplings
  filled with synthesized dragon meat, noodles that glow faintly, sake that
  shows you memories. The upper floors are private dining rooms for those
  who can afford discretion.

  The decor blends ancient temple aesthetics with sleek chrome and holographic
  art. A massive jade dragon statue dominates the entrance, its eyes following
  patrons with uncomfortable awareness.

atmosphere:
  lighting: "Warm lanterns, subtle neon accents, candlelit private rooms"
  sounds: "Soft traditional music, clinking glasses, hushed conversations"
  smells: "Exotic spices, grilled meats, expensive perfume, old incense"

proprietor:
  id: "madame-ling"
  name: "Madame Ling"
  description: |
    An elegant woman of indeterminate age who moves like smoke and speaks
    like honey over knives. She claims her family has run this establishment
    since before the current iteration of reality. Her jade hairpins are
    rumored to be fragments of something pre-Architect.
