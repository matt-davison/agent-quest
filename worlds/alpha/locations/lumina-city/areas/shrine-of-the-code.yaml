# Small temple dedicated to the Architects

id: "shrine-of-the-code"
name: "Shrine of the Code"
parent_location: "lumina-city"
type: "temple"
tier: 1

description: |
  A pocket of serenity in the neon chaos. The Shrine of the Code is a
  small temple wedged between towering buildings, its traditional
  architecture jarring against the chrome and glass. Paper lanterns
  float without strings. Incense burns that smells like old computers
  warming up.

  This is a place of worship for those who remember the Architects —
  the beings who wrote reality into existence. The faithful come to
  pray, to seek wisdom, and to leave offerings in hopes of touching
  something greater than themselves.

atmosphere:
  lighting: "Soft lantern glow, candlelight, occasional digital sparkles"
  sounds: "Silence, distant wind chimes, soft chanting"
  smells: "Incense, old paper, electricity, something ancient"

  name: "Sister Echo"
  description: |
    A young woman with luminous eyes that seem to look through rather
    than at you. She speaks rarely, and when she does, her words seem
    to arrive slightly before her lips move. Some say she has a direct
    connection to the underlying code.
  dialogue_hook: "*She gestures to the shrine, inviting you to approach.*"
  secrets:
    - "Can perceive Weave corruption without training"
    - "Receives visions from something in the deep code"
    - "Was found as a child in the ruins beneath the city, origin unknown"

    name: "The Offering Altar"
    description: |
      A stone altar covered in flickering holographic flames. Offerings
      placed here sometimes... vanish. And sometimes, something is left
      in return.

    discovery: "Reach Trusted standing with Sister Echo"
    content: |
      Sister Echo is not human. She's a fragment of something that
      existed before the current iteration of reality — possibly a
      creation of the Third Architect. She doesn't know this herself,
      but she sometimes speaks in languages that predate human existence.

  - id: "true-altar"
    discovery: "Make an offering of extreme personal value (100g+ or significant item)"
    content: |
      The altar is a terminal. The offerings are processed somewhere.
      The Architects — or something claiming to be them — occasionally
      respond. The messages are always cryptic. Always relevant. Always
      unsettling.

  - id: "beneath-shrine"
    discovery: "Meditate in the Bit Garden for 8+ hours"
    content: |
      The shrine was built atop a node in the original code — one of
      the points where the Architects actually wrote reality. It still
      functions. With the right knowledge, one could... make changes.
