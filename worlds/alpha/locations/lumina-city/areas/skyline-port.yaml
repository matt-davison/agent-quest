  The Skyline Port sits on top of Lumina's tallest spire — a wide platform of
  polished chrome and reinforced glass, open to the sky on all sides. Two airship
  docks jut out over the city like skeletal fingers. A holographic departures board
  flickers near the ticket counter. The air is clean and cold up here, above the
  smog line.
