# Description
description: |
  Lumina City sprawls across the western reaches like a fever dream of progress — a cyberpunk metropolis
  where holographic advertisements blot out the stars and corporate arcologies pierce the smog-choked sky.
  Here, magic and technology have merged so completely that no one remembers which came first.

  The city is divided into stacked layers: the glittering Skyline where the wealthy float in chrome towers,
  the neon-drenched Midstreets where most citizens hustle and dream, and the shadow-soaked Underlevel where
  the desperate and dangerous make their own rules.

  Ancient ruins lie beneath it all — remnants of a civilization that existed before the current iteration
  of reality. Sometimes the old code bleeds through, and the city... glitches.
