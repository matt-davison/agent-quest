  Hidden behind a wall of pure probability in the Weave Terminal, the Anchor
  Sanctum exists in a state of perfect stability—perhaps the most stable
  location in all reality. The chamber is circular, its walls inscribed with
  the names of every Anchor who has ever served. At the center, a single
  point of brilliant light hovers: the First Witness, said to be a fragment
  of Architect perception itself. Here, the Anchorate gathers to train,
  deliberate, and speak the Oath.

      Seven names glow brighter than all others—the Foundations. Six are

      The First Witness is not merely a light. It is the last fragment of
      Architect 02's consciousness—the one who created the Unwitnessed
      Peaks. In penance, they gave their ability to perceive, becoming
      the eternal first observer for all future witnessing.
