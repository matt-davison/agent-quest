description: |
  A circular plaza of crystalline tiles that pulse with soft light. New Weavers
  materialize here, drawn by forces they don't yet understand. The tiles respond
  to footsteps, creating ripples of luminescence that spread outward like digital
  waves. At the center stands the Awakening Obelisk, a towering structure of
  interwoven code and crystal.
