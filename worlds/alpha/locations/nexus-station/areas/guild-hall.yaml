  Headquarters for the various Weaver disciplines. The building is segmented
  into wings, each dedicated to a different class. Datamancers study in
  crystalline chambers filled with floating data. Debuggers train in
  reinforced arenas. Architects sketch impossible blueprints. Scribes
  practice their craft in quiet alcoves lined with ancient tomes.
