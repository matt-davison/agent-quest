# Outpost Greyspire

A remote military outpost holding the eastern frontier against the Ironjaw Clan and other dangers.

## Description

Perched on a windswept hill, Outpost Greyspire stands as the frontier's first and last line of defense. Stone walls reinforced with steel plating surround the compound. Watchtowers pierce the sky. The air smells of wood smoke, weapon oil, and the sharp scent of mountain herbs from the apothecary.

Commander Steele maintains iron discipline here. Supply runs are rare—the overland route is dangerous. Most provisions come from the quartermaster's careful rationing and local foraging. When a wagon arrives intact, it's cause for celebration among the troops.

The outpost is a place of routine punctuated by terror. Most days pass in drill and maintenance. Then, without warning, the Ironjaw Clan raids the roads. People die. Supplies burn. Life continues.
