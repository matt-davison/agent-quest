description: |
  A grand atrium where floating glyphs display class schedules, announcements,
  and the occasional error message from reality itself. A massive statue of a
  hooded figure—one of the First Architects, identity unknown—dominates the
  center, hands outstretched as if offering or receiving code. The ceiling
  stretches impossibly high, lost in floating equations.
