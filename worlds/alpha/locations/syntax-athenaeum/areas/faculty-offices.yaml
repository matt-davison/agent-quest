  Where the masters dwell. Each professor specializes in a different aspect
  of reality manipulation. The corridor seems to extend infinitely, with
  doors appearing and disappearing based on who you seek. Getting an
  appointment is half the challenge—some doors only appear at certain
  times, others require solving a puzzle to reveal.
