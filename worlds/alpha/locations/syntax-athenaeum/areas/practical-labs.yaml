  A reinforced wing where students practice manipulating the Weave under
  controlled conditions. Reality here is... flexible. Walls shift. Gravity
  is optional. Objects exist in quantum superposition until observed. The
  floors are marked with containment circles and warning glyphs. Scorched
  spots and reality-patches tell tales of experiments gone wrong.

      Physics is negotiable in the labs:
      - Gravity can be adjusted
      - Objects may exist in superposition
      - Failed experiments may have unexpected results

      Roll Mind check:
      - 15+: Success, create what you intended
      - 10-14: Partial success, minor variations
      - 5-9: Failure, minor backlash
      - 1-4: Critical failure, containment breach
