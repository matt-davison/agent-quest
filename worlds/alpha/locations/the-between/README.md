# The Between

## Overview

A corridor that exists between realities, neither fully in one world nor another. The Between is neutral ground by nature—no single reality can claim it, and all can access it. Here, diplomats from ten realities meet, treaties are forged, and the fundamental nature of existence is negotiated.

## Description

Walking the Between feels like moving through a space that hasn't decided what it is yet. Walls might be stone in one step, light in the next, then concept, then absence. The corridor shifts to accommodate its visitors—human-scale passages for humanoid diplomats, crystalline lattices for mineral intelligences, pure mathematical topology for abstract entities.

Time flows strangely here. Meetings that feel like hours might be seconds in base reality, or vice versa. The Between respects subjective experience more than objective measurement.

## Districts

### Hall of Tongues
Where all languages are understood. The air itself translates meaning, intention, and nuance. Even concepts that have no words in any known language can be communicated here.

- **Function**: Primary diplomatic meeting space
- **Feature**: Universal translation field
- **Use**: Negotiations, treaty discussions, first contact protocols

### Negotiation Chambers
Private rooms where sensitive discussions occur. Each chamber adapts to the comfort and security needs of its occupants.

- **Privacy**: Absolutely secure—what's said in chambers stays there
- **Features**: Adjustable reality-constants (time flow, physics, etc.)
- **Booking**: Requires diplomatic credentials or Embassy sponsorship

### Embassy Quarter
Where representatives from various realities maintain permanent presence. Each Embassy is a pocket dimension reflecting its home reality.

- **Fringe Embassy**: Established by Echo-Riven, neutral ground for Lost Weavers and Fringe-touched beings
- **Beyond Embassy**: Geometric structures representing the Beyond Concordat
- **Silence Embassy**: A space of absence where Null-All dwells
- **Seven Others**: Embassies for additional realities

### The Crossroads
Central plaza where all corridors meet. Information flows freely here, and one can learn much simply by listening.

- **Function**: Social hub, information exchange
- **Events**: Regular meetings, announcements, emergency gatherings
- **Danger**: Spies and information brokers frequent the area

## Inhabitants

### Permanent Residents
- **The Keepers**: Beings of pure protocol who maintain The Between
- **Boundary Wardens**: Enforcers of neutral-ground rules
- **Reality-Guides**: Assist visitors in navigating the shifting corridors

### Diplomatic Corps
- **Poly-Prime**: Beyond Concordat representative
- **Null-All**: Silence Court representative
- **Echo-Riven**: Fringe Embassy ambassador

## Rules of The Between

1. **No Violence**: Aggression is impossible here—weapons don't function, hostile intentions fade
2. **Truth Compulsion**: Active in Negotiation Chambers; deception is detectable
3. **Equal Standing**: All beings have equal rights regardless of power level outside
4. **Secrecy Protected**: Information shared in confidence cannot be extracted by force
5. **Voluntary Entry**: No one can be brought to The Between against their will

## Quest Hooks

- Mediate a dispute between two reality representatives
- Investigate a violation of Between neutrality
- Establish a new Embassy for an unrecognized reality
- Recover something that was lost between realities

## Special Mechanics

### Reality Anchoring
Visitors must maintain a tether to their home reality or risk dissolving into The Between. Most Embassies provide anchoring services.

### Diplomatic Immunity
Recognized diplomats cannot be harmed or detained while in The Between, and their words cannot be used against them outside.

## Connected Locations

- **All Realities**: The Between touches everything and nothing simultaneously
- **Weave-Market**: Regular market phases occur here
- **Syntax Athenaeum**: Academic access point for research purposes
- **The Fringes**: The Between bleeds into unstable reality at its edges
