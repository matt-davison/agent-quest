# The Fold

> _"Between what is rendered and what is not, there are cracks. Some of them breathe."_

## Description

The Fold is a void-pocket — a gap in the compiled fabric of reality that exists between Nexus Station and Lumina City. It was never meant to be a place. It's a seam where two regions of the world didn't quite stitch together, left unpatched since the Architects' era.

From the outside, it appears as a barely-visible vertical shimmer in the cable ruins along the West Road, roughly twenty meters off the path. Only those with void-sensitivity or exceptional perception can detect it. Stepping through requires either Voidwalker affinity or a Phase-type ability.

Inside, the pocket is roughly the size of a small courtyard. The ground is smooth and undefined — neither stone nor metal. The walls are the shimmering edges of rendered reality. Above, raw Architect code scrolls upward in green characters on black void.

## Points of Interest

### The Cracked Obelisk

A chest-height stone marker at the center of the Fold. Covered in symbols — some readable, some corrupted, some flickering. Bears a clean handprint in the dust, origin unknown. The obelisk predates the current era and may be an Architect waymarker for navigating uncompiled space.

**Interactions:**
- Examine symbols (Mind check DC 12 for partial translation)
- Place hand on the clean handprint (unknown effect)
- Attempt to Mend corrupted symbols (Weave Mending DC 16)

### The Still Pool

A small pool of mercury-like liquid at the obelisk's base. Reflects no light. Surface is perfectly still unless disturbed. May function similarly to the Memory Pools in the Undercrypt, but uncorrupted.

**Interactions:**
- Look into the pool (Spirit check DC 10)
- Touch the surface (unknown effect)
- Attempt to scry (Spirit check DC 14)

## NPCs

None. This place is empty and has been for a very long time.

## Secrets

<details>
<summary>The Handprint</summary>

The clean handprint on the obelisk was left by a Voidwalker who passed through decades ago. Placing your own hand on it may trigger a resonance — a connection to whoever was here before. The obelisk is a waymarker in a network of Folds that spans the world, used by the Architects to travel between uncompiled spaces.

<details>
<summary>The Pool's Purpose</summary>

The pool is a void-mirror — it shows not reflections but *absences*. Things that were removed from reality. Deleted code. Lost memories. Erased people. Looking into it with sufficient Spirit reveals fragments of what the Architects tried to hide.

## Lore Connections

- Related to: Architect infrastructure, void-space navigation
- The Fold may be one node in a network of similar pockets scattered across the world
- Voidwalkers have a natural affinity for these spaces — they were the Architects' couriers
