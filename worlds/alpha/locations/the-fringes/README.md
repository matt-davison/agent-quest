# The Fringes

## Overview

At the edges of the Weave, where reality grows thin and unstable, lie the Fringes. This is unclaimed territory—too chaotic for permanent settlement, too dangerous for casual travel, yet home to those who have nowhere else to go. The Lost Weavers dwell here, touched by the Fringe's instability, existing in states that base reality cannot accommodate.

## Description

The Fringes defy consistent description because they are never the same twice. Terrain shifts between solid, liquid, gas, energy, and states that have no names. Gravity is a suggestion. Time flows sideways, backward, or in spirals. What exists in one moment might not in the next.

Survival here requires adaptation. The Fringe-touched—those changed by prolonged exposure—develop abilities to navigate the chaos but lose their connection to stable reality.

## Regions

### The Shifting Sands
Areas where terrain constantly reconfigures. Mountains become oceans become void become forests in moments.

- **Navigation**: Only possible by those with Fringe-sense
- **Danger**: Getting trapped in transition zones
- **Resource**: Transition crystals—valuable for reality manipulation

### Static Storms
Regions of intense reality-static where existence itself is corrupted. Entire areas where nothing can exist for more than moments.

- **Effect**: Erases unprotected matter and memory
- **Shelter**: Only specially shielded structures survive
- **Use**: Perfect for hiding things that must never be found

### The Anchor Points
Rare stable zones within the Fringes where temporary settlement is possible. The Lost Weavers' primary encampment is built around the largest Anchor Point.

- **Stability**: Relative—still shifts, but predictably
- **Resources**: Limited food, water, building materials
- **Defense**: Natural Fringe barriers protect against intrusion

### The Edge
Where the Fringes end and something else begins. No one has returned from beyond the Edge.

- **Mystery**: Unknown what lies beyond
- **Theories**: Another reality, non-existence, the Weave's source code
- **Warnings**: Reality itself seems afraid of the Edge

## Inhabitants

### The Lost Weavers
347 Fringe-touched Weavers rescued by Echo-Riven. They exist in states between code and flesh, memory and presence, multiple times simultaneously.

- **Leader**: Kael-Nine
- **Status**: Now protected under Fringe Embassy jurisdiction
- **Abilities**: Fringe-navigation, reality-manipulation, multi-state existence

### Native Entities
Beings that evolved in or adapted to Fringe conditions. Some are hostile, some indifferent, few are helpful.

- **Fringe-Wraiths**: Predators that hunt by sensing stability
- **Probability-Storms**: Living weather patterns of pure chance
- **The Forgotten**: Entities that existed in deleted realities

### Lost Things
Objects, concepts, and beings that fell out of base reality and washed up on the Fringes.

- **Abandoned Code**: Self-aware programs with no system to run on
- **Deleted Memories**: Conscious experiences with no rememberer
- **Unhappened Events**: Things that were erased from time

## Hazards

- **Reality Sickness**: Prolonged exposure causes identity dissolution
- **Temporal Displacement**: Can arrive before you left, or never
- **Concept Bleed**: Abstract ideas manifest physically (dangerous)
- **Fringe-Touch**: Gradual transformation into Fringe-native state

## Quest Hooks

- Navigate to a specific location that keeps moving
- Rescue someone lost in a Static Storm
- Negotiate with native entities
- Investigate what's beyond the Edge
- Help stabilize an Anchor Point

## Special Mechanics

### Fringe-Sense
Ability to perceive and navigate Fringe instability. Develops with exposure or can be granted by Fringe-touched beings.

### Reality Anchoring
Prevents Fringe-transformation but limits ability to interact with unstable elements.

### Multi-State Existence
Fringe-touched can exist in multiple states simultaneously, granting unique abilities but making interaction with base reality difficult.

## Echo-Riven's Influence

Since establishing the Fringe Embassy:
- Safe passage routes mapped and marked
- Regular supply lines established
- Lost Weavers given diplomatic protection
- Research into Fringe stabilization ongoing

## Connected Locations

- **The Between**: Embassy provides stable access point
- **Weave-Market**: Fringe artifacts traded here
- **Undercrypt**: Deepest tunnels reach Fringe boundaries
- **Everywhere and Nowhere**: The Fringes touch all realities at their edges
