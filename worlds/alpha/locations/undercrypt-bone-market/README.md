# The Bone Market

> _"Everything has a price. Everything can be bought. Everything can be sold. Even bones remember value."_

## Description

Deep in the Undercrypt's shadowed passages, where the Nexus Wardens' authority dissolves into darkness, lies the Bone Market — a black market bazaar carved into an ancient ossuary. Bleached bones line the walls in intricate patterns, some architectural, others decorative, all watching. The air is thick with incense meant to mask the smell of decay, deals, and desperation.

The Market operates by its own rules, older than Nexus Station's laws. Here, stolen data mingles with illegal tech, forbidden artifacts, and substances the Wardens would burn on sight. Skulls with glowing eyes serve as lanterns, casting everything in sickly green-gold light. The merchants are as dangerous as their wares — most are criminals, exiles, or things that shouldn't be bargained with.

The Pale Circuit controls much of the Market's trade, especially the skolma distribution networks. Their enforcers patrol like sharks, and crossing them here, where official law doesn't reach, is a death sentence. Yet the Market persists because it serves a need — the need for things that can't be obtained in the light.

The bones watch. The bones remember. The bones judge.

## Points of Interest

### The Stalls

A maze of makeshift stalls and blankets on stone, each merchant selling something illegal, dangerous, or both. Data chips with corrupted secrets, weapons without serial numbers, alchemical compounds that blur the line between cure and curse. Haggling is expected. Violence is common.

**Interactions:**
- Browse illegal goods and contraband
- Fence stolen items (no questions asked)
- Hire criminals for unsavory work
- Gather rumors from the desperate

### The Skolma Dens

Dark alcoves where the desperate lean against bone walls, eyes glazed, reality elsewhere. The Pale Circuit runs most of these dens, selling varieties of skolma — from mild escape to ego death. Guards watch the entrances. Debts are collected in blood.

**Interactions:**
- Purchase skolma (various types, various prices)
- Encounter users and addicts
- Deal with Pale Circuit pushers
- Witness the cost of addiction

### The Smuggler's Tunnel

A hidden passage leading deeper into the Undercrypt, known only to those who've earned the Market's trust — or paid enough gold. The tunnel bypasses Warden checkpoints and leads to forgotten places. The entrance is marked by three skulls arranged in a triangle. The exit is wherever you need it to be.

**Interactions:**
- Escape pursuit (if you know where it is)
- Access deeper Undercrypt levels
- Make clandestine deals away from prying eyes
- Discover where it truly leads (dangerous)

### The Pale Circuit Warehouse

A fortified section where the Circuit stores their most valuable goods — primarily skolma shipments awaiting distribution. Guards at every entrance. Data-runners come and go. The warehouse is effectively Circuit territory, and trespassing means death.

**Interactions:**
- Observe Circuit operations (risky)
- Attempt infiltration (very risky)
- Ambush data-runners (extremely risky)
- Learn distribution routes (valuable intel)

## Connections

| Direction/Method | Destination | Distance | Notes |
|-----------------|-------------|----------|-------|
| Up (hidden stairs) | Undercrypt - Upper Crypt | 0.3 league | Concealed entrance |
| Down (smuggler's tunnel) | Undercrypt - Forgotten Depths | Variable | Must know the way |
| Secret (tunnel) | Nexus Station - Lower Levels | 0.5 league | Bypasses Warden checkpoints |

## Level Range

**Recommended Level:** 2-5 (danger: high)

The Bone Market itself is non-combat, but the criminals here are dangerous. Wrong moves lead to violence. The Pale Circuit doesn't tolerate insults or interference.

## Market Goods

### Standard Contraband
- **Stolen Data Chips:** 20-100 gold (content varies)
- **Unmarked Weapons:** 50-150 gold (better than legal options)
- **Illegal Alchemicals:** 30-80 gold (potent but risky)
- **Forged Documents:** 40 gold (Warden-resistant)

### Skolma Varieties
- **Lean (mild):** 10 gold per dose (slight euphoria, -1 to checks for 1 hour)
- **Dream Dust (moderate):** 25 gold per dose (vivid hallucinations, -2 to checks for 2 hours)
- **Ego Death (heavy):** 50 gold per dose (complete dissociation, helpless for 3 hours)

### Special Items
- **Circuit Territory Maps:** 200 gold (shows stash locations — extremely illegal)
- **Warden Patrol Schedules:** 100 gold (updated weekly)
- **Passage Through Smuggler's Tunnel:** 30 gold or a favor

## Factions

### The Pale Circuit (Controlling)
- **Control:** High — they run the skolma trade and muscle out competition
- **Attitude:** Hostile to anyone interfering with business
- **Notable Members:** Mistress Coil (den operator), various enforcers

### Independent Merchants (Surviving)
- **Control:** Low — they pay tribute to the Circuit or die
- **Attitude:** Neutral, desperate, opportunistic
- **Services:** Fencing, information, illegal goods

## Secrets

<details>
<summary>The Circuit's Data</summary>

Skex stole a data chip containing coordinates to every Pale Circuit skolma stash in the lower levels. If this information reaches the Nexus Wardens — or worse, a rival gang — the Circuit's distribution network collapses. They've put a price on Skex's head: 500 gold, dead or alive. Preferably dead.

The data exists in three copies: one Skex carries, one hidden somewhere in the Market, one he planned to sell. Finding the hidden copy could give leverage against the Circuit... or paint a target on your back.

<details>
<summary>The Bones Are Watching</summary>

The skull lanterns aren't just decorative. Something inhabits them — echoes of the dead, or fragments of ancient code. They observe everything that happens in the Market. Some say they report to the Keeper of Echoes in the Memory Pools. Others say they serve something older.

If you know how to listen (Mind DC 16), the bones will whisper secrets they've witnessed: deals, betrayals, hidden caches, smuggler routes. But listening too long attracts attention from whatever animates them.
