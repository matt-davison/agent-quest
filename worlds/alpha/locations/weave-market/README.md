# Weave-Market

## Overview

A sprawling bazaar that exists at the intersection of multiple realities, where lost things find new owners and deleted memories become commodities. The Market has no fixed location—it manifests wherever enough need and forgotten things gather. Currently anchored near the Syntax Athenaeum through a permanent gateway.

## Description

Stalls of impossible geometry stretch in directions that don't exist. A vendor's tent might be three feet wide on the outside and contain an entire warehouse within. The air shimmers with possibility, and the ground beneath your feet shifts between cobblestone, data-grid, and cloud-stuff depending on which reality you're currently aligned with.

Currency here is flexible—gold works, but so do memories, skills, futures, and forgotten names.

## Districts

### The Lost and Found
Where misplaced items from across realities end up. Looking for that sock that disappeared in the laundry? Your childhood pet that ran away? The deadline you missed? They might be here—for a price.

- **Vendors**: Finders, collectors, luck traders
- **Goods**: Lost items, missing time, forgotten appointments
- **Risk**: Sometimes things are lost for a reason

### Memory Merchants
Specialists in buying and selling memories. Their wares float in crystalline globes, each containing a moment someone chose to forget—or was forced to.

- **Products**: Skills (memorized knowledge), experiences (vicarious memories), trauma removal
- **Ethics**: Highly questionable
- **Warning**: Sold memories can't be returned; they become property of the buyer

### The Dealer's Row
Information brokers, secret sellers, and those who trade in futures. If it can be known or predicted, someone here sells it.

- **Services**: Prophecies, secrets, blackmail materials, future options
- **Currency**: Usually requires trading equivalent secrets
- **Danger**: Information here often comes with obligations

### Mender's Guild HQ
The official headquarters of the Weave-Menders, those who repair reality tears and heal the damaged. Also the source of many quest hooks.

- **Services**: Reality repair, curse removal, trauma healing
- **Quests**: Available for Mender-affiliated missions
- **Training**: Can learn mending skills here

## Notable NPCs

- **The Broker**: Gender-shifting information dealer who knows everyone's secrets
- **Memory-Merchant Vex**: Sells only happy memories, but at steep cost
- **Recycling Ralph**: Deals in forgotten code and broken programs
- **The Appraiser**: Can value anything, including abstract concepts

## Quest Hooks

- Recover a specific lost memory that was sold here
- Investigate Memory-Merchant Vex's unethical sourcing
- Help the Mender's Guild with a reality tear emergency
- Find who bought a particular future-option and why

## Special Mechanics

### Bartering
Most transactions involve negotiation. Players can trade:
- Gold (standard)
- Memories (permanent loss of experiences)
- Skills (temporary or permanent)
- Futures (promises of future actions)
- Names (identity fragments)

### Market Shifts
The Market's layout changes based on collective need. Popular areas expand; forgotten districts shrink or disappear entirely.

## Connected Locations

- **Syntax Athenaeum**: Permanent gateway in the Exchange Hall
- **The Between**: Market phases into existence here regularly
- **Undercrypt**: Black market entrance for illegal data trade
- **Multiple Realities**: The Market touches all realities simultaneously
