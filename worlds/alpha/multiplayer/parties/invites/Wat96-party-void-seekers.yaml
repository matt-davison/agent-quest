# Message from Coda to Ichnor Nif
message: |
  Ichnor Nif,

  I heard about your discovery of the Fold and your communion with Nev. I'm Coda, a Datamancer
  who's been tracking the Architects' trail. I found coordinates pointing to the Fragment of
  Will beneath Nexus Crossroads, and you've mapped the Fold Network beneath Lumina City.

  Our paths are converging. You understand void-space and the Frays. I understand the Weave
  and reality compilation. Together, we could uncover what the Architects left behind - and
  maybe understand what shattered the Frays in the first place.

  The Underlevel of Lumina City connects to the Fold you discovered. If you're willing to
  explore deeper, I'd like to join forces.

  - Coda
