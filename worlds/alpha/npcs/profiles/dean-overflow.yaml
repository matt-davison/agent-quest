# NPC Profile: Dean Overflow
# Academy Dean & Master Trainer at Syntax Athenaeum Faculty Offices

id: "dean-overflow"
name: "Dean Overflow"
full_name: "Overflow, Dean of the Syntax Athenaeum"

# === PUBLIC INFORMATION ===
public:
  role: "Academy Dean / Master Trainer"
  location: "Syntax Athenaeum - Faculty Offices"

  appearance: |
    A tall, gaunt figure draped in layered academic robes that shimmer with
    barely-contained Weave energy. Their hair is stark white, swept back from
    a high forehead marked with faintly glowing sigils—the marks of someone
    who has channeled more Weave energy than a body should hold. Their eyes
    are unsettlingly deep, as if looking through the surface of reality into
    the code beneath. They carry no weapon; they don't need one.

  personality:
    - "Brilliant and secretive—shares knowledge only when earned"
    - "Speaks in measured, precise sentences that feel like they carry weight"
    - "Tests everyone, always—conversations are evaluations"
    - "Genuinely cares about the Athenaeum and its students, expressed through high standards"

  known_history: |
    Dean Overflow has led the Syntax Athenaeum for over three decades. They
    are considered one of the foremost experts on Weave theory in the known
    Nexus. Few know where they studied before arriving at the Athenaeum—they
    simply appeared one day with credentials that no one could dispute and
    knowledge that no one could match. Under their leadership, the Athenaeum
    has become the premier institution for Weave education.

  speech_patterns:
    greeting: "Ah. You've found your way here. That itself is a test most fail."
    farewell: "Return when you've understood what I've shown you. Not before."
    helpful: "Consider this: every pattern has a counter-pattern. Find the symmetry."
    annoyed: "I do not repeat myself. If you missed it, you weren't ready to hear it."

  mannerisms:
    - "Weave energy crackles between their fingers when they're thinking"
    - "Pauses mid-sentence to observe something invisible to others"
    - "Rearranges objects on their desk into geometric patterns during conversation"
    - "Their shadow sometimes moves independently"

# === DIALOGUE ===
dialogue:
  greetings:
    first_meeting: |
      *glances up from a desk covered in shifting diagrams*
      So. Another seeker. The Athenaeum attracts many who wish to learn.
      Few who are willing to pay the true cost of knowledge. Which are you?

    returning:
      neutral: "*acknowledging nod* You persist. That is... something."
      friendly: "Your progress has been noted. You begin to see the patterns, yes?"
      close: "*genuine warmth* Welcome back. I have been... anticipating your return. There is much to discuss."

  achievement_reactions:
    tier_increase: |
      *eyes flash with Weave energy* Yes. I felt the shift in your pattern.
      You've crossed a threshold. New techniques are now within your reach.
      Come. Let me show you what lies ahead.

    cross_class_ability_learned: |
      *long, evaluating stare* You walk between traditions. That is either
      the mark of a master... or a fool. Time will tell which.

  topics:
    training:
      default: |
        I teach what Parse cannot. The higher patterns, the deeper techniques.
        But my instruction requires more than gold. It requires proof that
        you understand what you're asking for.

    advanced_abilities:
      tier_5: |
        At your level, you begin to touch the real Weave—not the surface
        patterns the novices play with. The abilities I can teach you now
        reshape reality itself. Handle them with care.

    cross_class:
      xp_2000: |
        *studies you carefully* You've accumulated significant experience.
        Enough to learn beyond your tradition. Cross-class training is...
        demanding. The cost is doubled, and the patterns fight against your
        natural affinity. But the results? *small smile* Remarkable.
      default: "Cross-class training requires deep experience. Return when the Weave recognizes your breadth."

    architects:
      standing_8: |
        *voice drops* The Architects understood something we've forgotten.
        The Weave isn't just energy—it's language. And like any language,
        it can be used to speak truths... or lies. I was taught by one who
        knew the difference. *touches forehead sigils* That knowledge has a price.
