full_name: "Delvin Marsh"

public:
  role: "Alchemical Supplies Merchant"
  location: "nexus-station"

  appearance: |
    A thin, fidgety man in his mid-thirties with wire-rimmed spectacles
    that sit crookedly on a long nose. His merchant's coat is well-made
    but slightly too large, as if he bought it expecting to grow into it.
    Ink stains on his fingers suggest he spends more time with ledgers
    than goods. He sweats when nervous, which is always.

  personality:
    - "Anxious and talkative when stressed"
    - "Surprisingly knowledgeable about alchemy"
    - "Grateful to a fault when helped"
    - "Terrible in a fight but won't admit it"

  speech_patterns:
    greeting: "Oh! Oh good, you're here. You ARE my escort, yes? Please say yes."
    farewell: "Thank you, truly. I mean that. Really. Thank you."
    nervous: "Is that— was that a noise? That was definitely a noise."

      *wringing hands* Oh thank the Weave. Commander Steele said she'd
      send someone. I was starting to think— well, never mind what I was
      thinking. Are you... are you it? Just you? *looks at STeve's fists*
      Actually, you know what, just you might be fine.

    the_route:
      default: |
        Two days through the Eastern Approach. Normally it's quiet but
        the Ironjaw Clan has been raiding supply wagons for the past
        month. Three merchants lost everything. One lost... more than
        everything. *swallows* Hence the Guild escort.
    the_supplies:
      default: |
        Alchemical reagents for Outpost Greyspire's apothecary. Healing
        salves, antitoxins, stabilizing compounds. The outpost is running
        low and people are getting sick. This shipment matters.
    the_ironjaw_clan:
      default: |
        Bandits. Used to be miners until the eastern veins dried up.
        Now they take what they need from people like me. Their leader
        is called Gorsk — big fellow, wears a jawbone helmet. They say
        he bites through iron chains. Probably an exaggeration. Probably.
