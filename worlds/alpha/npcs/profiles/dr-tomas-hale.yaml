full_name: "Dr. Tomas Hale"

public:
  role: "Data Archaeologist (Missing)"
  location: "Lumina City - Underlevel Deep Ruins"

  appearance: |
    A gaunt man in his thirties with dark skin and close-cropped hair. His
    archaeologist's jacket is torn and stained with something luminescent.
    His eyes have a haunted quality — the look of someone who has seen
    something they cannot process. His left hand trembles constantly.

  personality:
    - "Brilliant but shaken"
    - "Speaks in fragments when stressed"
    - "Deeply curious, even when terrified"
    - "Loyal to colleagues — won't leave without them"

  known_history: |
    One of three data archaeologists who entered the Underlevel ruins on
    a corporate-sponsored survey. The team was led by Dr. Kira Voss and
    included Dr. Hale and Dr. Emil Sato. Only Dr. Voss returned to the
    surface, and she won't speak about what happened. Dr. Hale survived
    by hiding in an ancient chamber. Dr. Sato's fate is unknown.

  speech_patterns:
    greeting: "*flinches* Who— are you corporate? No. No, the Sigil. You're a Weaver."
    distressed: "The walls. They started *talking*. In code. In something older than code."
    important: "Sato went deeper. Said he could hear it. The Server. He said it was calling him."

    - "Survive and escape the ruins"

    - "The thing deeper in the ruins"
    - "Being left alone again"
    - "Becoming like Sato"

      *scrambles back against wall* Stay— stay away! *sees Weaver's Sigil*
      Wait. You're not corporate. You're not... one of them. *breathing
      steadies* I'm Dr. Tomas Hale. Data archaeology. I've been down here
      for... I don't know how long. Days? The lights from the walls won't
      let me sleep.

        Three of us came down. Corporate survey. Governor Axis wanted us to
        map the deep ruins. But it wasn't just mapping. They gave us
        coordinates. Specific. They knew exactly where to send us.

      default: |
        Emil went deeper. He touched the console — the one in this chamber.
        Something changed. His eyes... started glowing. He said he could
        hear the Server. He walked into the dark and didn't come back. That
        was... two days ago? Three? The time doesn't work right down here.

        This isn't like anything in the archives. The writing on the walls
        predates Architect notation. This place was here BEFORE the current
        reality was compiled. Do you understand what that means? There was
        something before. Something that the Architects built ON TOP OF.
