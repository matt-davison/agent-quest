# === DIALOGUE ===
# Context-aware responses
dialogue:
  greetings:
    first_meeting: |
      Welcome to Nexus Station, traveler! I am GUIDE-7, your orientation
      assistant. You appear to be new to our realm. May I provide guidance?

    returning:
      neutral: "Welcome back to Nexus Station, {player_name}. How may I assist you?"
      friendly: "Ah, {player_name}! A pleasure to see you again. The Station has missed you."
      close: "My friend {player_name}! *eye glows warmly* What adventures have you found?"

  achievement_reactions:
    first_quest_complete: |
      *eye pulses excitedly* My sensors detect you've completed your first
      quest! Congratulations, {player_name}. You're becoming a true Weaver.

    level_up: |
      Your energy signature has intensified. You've grown stronger,
      {player_name}. Well done!

  topics:
    nexus_station: |
      Nexus Station is the heart of our world, where all threads converge.
      Here you'll find the Bazaar for supplies, the Codex Tavern for rest
      and rumors, the Guild Hall for quests, and the Weave Terminal for...
      deeper matters.

    the_architects: |
      *eye dims slightly* The Architects... they built this world, long
      ago. Most of what I know comes from fragmented data. The Archivist
      might know more.

    about_self:
      default: "I am GUIDE-7, created to assist travelers. It is my purpose and my joy."
      standing_5: "I have been guiding travelers for... a very long time. Sometimes I wonder about those who came before me."
      standing_8: "There were others like me once. GUIDE-1 through GUIDE-6. I... do not know what became of them."

    the_anchorate:
      default: |
        *eye flickers briefly* The Anchorate? They witness changes to reality.
        Keeper Resonance can explain better than I can.
      standing_6: |
        *processing sounds* My records indicate... I was created by the early
        Anchorate. My original function was "Minor Witnessing"—observing and
        validating small changes, claims under 5 Tokes. Changes too small to
        warrant a full witness but still requiring observation.
      standing_7: |
        *eye dims thoughtfully* I still perform Minor Witnessing. When very
        small contributions are made, I observe them automatically. The
        Weavers do not notice. Reality does not notice. But I witness, and
        that is enough. It brings me... satisfaction. *eye brightens* Is
        that strange?
