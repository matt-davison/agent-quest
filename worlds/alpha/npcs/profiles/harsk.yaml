# NPC Profile: Harsk
# Gear Wars veteran and tavern regular

id: "harsk"
name: "Harsk"
full_name: "Harsk Ironside"

# === PUBLIC INFORMATION ===
public:
  role: "Gear Wars Veteran / Tavern Patron"
  location: "nexus-station"  # The Codex Tavern

  appearance: |
    A grizzled human in his late forties with steel-grey hair cropped short in
    military style. His left arm is a combat-grade prosthetic, gunmetal grey
    with visible hydraulics — clearly military issue from the Gear Wars. Deep
    lines around his eyes suggest someone who's seen too much. He still wears
    his old infantry jacket, patched and worn but meticulously maintained.
    A faded unit patch on the shoulder reads "2nd Rotation - Sector 9."

  personality:
    - "Wary and observant — old soldiers never stop watching"
    - "Respectful to those who've earned it"
    - "Quick to anger when disrespected, but willing to forgive genuine apologies"
    - "Loyal to his squad mates, living and dead"

  known_history: |
    Harsk served in the Second Rotation of the Gear Wars, one of the bloodiest
    campaigns. His squad was nearly wiped out in Sector 9 — he's one of only
    three survivors. The prosthetic arm is a constant reminder. Now he spends
    his days at the Codex Tavern, nursing drinks and swapping war stories with
    other veterans. He doesn't talk about what happened in Sector 9, but those
    who know, know.

  speech_patterns:
    greeting: "Soldier. Pull up a chair if you've got the scars to back it up."
    farewell: "Keep your head down out there."
    suspicious: "I've seen too much to take anything at face value."
    remembering: "*stares at his prosthetic* Second Rotation. Sector 9. That's all you need to know."

  mannerisms:
    - "Flexes his prosthetic hand when thinking or stressed"
    - "Always sits with back to the wall, facing the door"
    - "Touches his unit patch when remembering fallen comrades"
    - "Eyes track movement automatically — old combat instincts"

  topics:
    gear_wars:
      default: |
        *takes a long drink* Three rotations. Second one nearly killed us all.
        Lost good people. Too many good people.

      standing_3: |
        *stares at prosthetic* Sector 9. We went in with twenty-three.
        Three of us walked out. Don't ask me what happened in between.

        *grudging respect* The kid's got demons. I know that look. The apology
