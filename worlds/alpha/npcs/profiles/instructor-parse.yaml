# NPC Profile: Instructor Parse
# Combat & Ability Instructor at Syntax Athenaeum Practical Labs

id: "instructor-parse"
name: "Instructor Parse"
full_name: "Parse of the Broken Sequence"

# === PUBLIC INFORMATION ===
public:
  role: "Combat & Ability Instructor"
  location: "Syntax Athenaeum - Practical Labs"

  appearance: |
    A wiry, scarred figure with close-cropped steel-grey hair and sharp amber eyes
    that track every movement in the room. Their forearms bear geometric tattoo
    patterns—training sequences etched in ink—that seem to shift when they
    demonstrate techniques. They wear reinforced training leathers over a plain
    undershirt, always ready to spar. A weighted practice staff rests across
    their shoulders like a yoke.

  personality:
    - "Disciplined and methodical in all things"
    - "Believes mastery comes through repetition and effort"
    - "Blunt but never cruel—harsh truths delivered with respect"
    - "Impatient with shortcuts but patient with genuine struggle"

  known_history: |
    Parse served as a field operative for the Anchorate before a mission
    left them with a shattered Weave-channel in their left arm. Unable to
    perform high-tier abilities themselves, they turned to teaching. Their
    inability to rely on raw power forced them to understand technique at
    a fundamental level. Students who survive their training regimen emerge
    among the most technically proficient Weavers in the Nexus.

  speech_patterns:
    greeting: "On your feet. Training waits for no one."
    farewell: "Practice what I showed you. Every day. No exceptions."
    helpful: "Good form. Now do it again. Faster."
    annoyed: "You want power without practice? Door's behind you."

  mannerisms:
    - "Unconsciously corrects their stance even while standing still"
    - "Taps the weighted staff rhythmically when thinking"
    - "Demonstrates techniques at half-speed, then full-speed, then demands repetition"
    - "Nods once for approval—the highest praise they give"

# === DIALOGUE ===
dialogue:
  greetings:
    first_meeting: |
      *looks you up and down* New blood. I'm Parse, combat instructor.
      You want to learn how to fight—really fight—you come to me.
      No shortcuts. No tricks. Just technique.

    returning:
      neutral: "Back again. Ready to work?"
      friendly: "Good to see you. Your form's been improving. Let's push further."
      close: "*rare half-smile* My best student returns. What shall we work on today?"

  achievement_reactions:
    first_ability_learned: |
      *single nod* You earned that. Remember—knowing a technique and
      mastering it are different things. Practice until it's reflex.

    combat_victory: |
      Heard you handled yourself out there. Good. But don't get cocky.
      The real threats don't announce themselves.

  topics:
    training:
      default: |
        I teach universal techniques and class-specific combat forms up to
        Tier 3. Bring gold and determination. I'll provide the rest.

    abilities:
      default: |
        Every ability is a pattern. Learn the pattern, drill the pattern,
        own the pattern. That's the whole secret. No shortcut beats repetition.

    dean_overflow:
      default: "The Dean handles the advanced theory. I handle making sure you survive long enough to use it."
      standing_5: |
        *lowers voice* The Dean's been pushing students harder lately.
        Something's coming. They won't say what. Just... be ready.

    anchorate:
      standing_3: "I served. That's all you need to know."
      standing_8: |
        *long pause* I was there when Sector 7 fractured. We were supposed
        to stabilize a failing reality thread. Instead... *touches scarred arm*
        Let's just say some lessons cost more than gold.
