description: |
  Kael-Nine is the elected leader of the 347 Lost Weavers rescued from the Fringes 
  by Echo-Riven. Their body constantly shifts between states—sometimes appearing as 
  a single humanoid figure, sometimes as nine overlapping versions of themselves 
  from different probability branches, sometimes as pure information without physical 
  form. The "Nine" in their name reflects this multiplicity.

appearance:
  description: |
    Kael-Nine's form is in constant flux. Primary form appears as humanoid, 
    gender-fluid, mid-twenties appearance. Secondary form shows nine translucent 
    overlays showing different possible versions. Tertiary form is pure light/data 
    when communicating complex concepts. Quaternary form is absence/negative space 
    when experiencing strong emotion.

background:
  before_fringes: |
    Kael was a Weaver from base reality who ventured too deep into unstable 
    territory during a reality-mapping expedition. Trapped by a Static Storm, 
    they spent years adapting to survive.
  in_fringes: |
    The transformation was gradual but irreversible. Kael became Kael-Nine, 
    existing in multiple states simultaneously. They organized other Lost Weavers 
    into a community, creating structure in chaos.
  rescue: |
    When Echo-Riven found them, 347 Lost Weavers were on the brink of dissolving 
    into the Fringes completely. Echo-Riven's intervention saved them and gave 
    them diplomatic status.

dialogue:
  first_meeting: |
    "You gave us back our existence. Before you, we were fading—becoming stories 
    that the Fringes tell about themselves. Now we have the Embassy, we have 
    protection, we have purpose. I am Kael-Nine, Speaker for the Lost. My life—and 
    all 347 lives I speak for—belongs to you."
  about_lost_weavers: |
    "We're not what we were. The Fringes changed us. Some see it as curse, some 
    as evolution. I see it as both. We exist in states your reality wasn't built 
    to accommodate—but that doesn't make us monsters. It makes us pioneers."
  about_fringes: |
    "It's not evil. It's not good. It's... potential without limit. Reality that 
    hasn't decided what to be. Beautiful and terrible. We learned to survive there, 
    but survival isn't living. You gave us more than rescue—you gave us hope of a 
    real life."
  about_echo_riven: |
    "You're the first being we've met who understands us without fear. You exist 
    between states like we do. You are The Bridge—and we will help you build it, 
    whatever the cost."
