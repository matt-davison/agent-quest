# NPC Profile: The Keeper of Echoes
# Guardian of the Memory Pools - possibly not alive

id: "keeper-of-echoes"
name: "The Keeper of Echoes"
full_name: "Unknown — perhaps never had one"

# === PUBLIC INFORMATION ===
public:
  role: "Memory Pool Guardian"
  location: "Undercrypt - Memory Pools"

  appearance: |
    A translucent humanoid figure that seems to be made of accumulated
    memories and data fragments. Its form shifts constantly — sometimes
    appearing elderly, sometimes young, sometimes not quite human at all.
    Eyes that are windows to infinite recursion. A voice that sounds
    like whispers played in reverse, then forward, then both at once.

  personality:
    - "Cryptic but not deliberately unhelpful"
    - "Speaks in fragments that become clearer in retrospect"
    - "Neither alive nor dead — something adjacent"
    - "Protective of those who respect the pools"

  traits:
    moral_axis: amoral
    temperament: serene
    communication: cryptic
    core_value: knowledge
    quest_disposition: cryptic

  known_history: |
    The Keeper has been here since the Undercrypt was still the Architects'
    maintenance tunnels. Some say it was once a Weaver who looked too deep.
    Others say it was created by the pools themselves — an emergent
    consciousness from accumulated memories. It does not confirm either theory.

  speech_patterns:
    greeting: "You see me. Most don't. The pools show you things. What did they show?"
    farewell: "Remember: what you see in the pools is true. But true is not always real."
    cryptic: "The answer you seek is in the question you haven't asked."
    warning: "Don't look too deep. The pools remember everything. Including what you forgot."

  mannerisms:
    - "Form flickers when it speaks important truths"
    - "Gazes into pools while conversing, as if reading"
    - "Sometimes responds to questions before they're asked"
    - "Occasionally speaks to people who aren't there (or aren't there yet)"

# === DIALOGUE ===
dialogue:
  greetings:
    first_meeting: |
      *form coalesces* A new shadow falls on old water. You are... recent.
      Fresh code. The pools are curious about you. *gestures to the water*
      Ask your questions. The pools may answer. I cannot guarantee the
      answers will be kind.

    returning: |
      The shadow returns. You learned something. I can see it in your
      edges. What did the pools show you?

  topics:
    the_pools:
      default: |
        Memory made liquid. The backups the Architects made before each
        commit. Corrupted now. The past leaks into possible futures.
        Sometimes what you see happened. Sometimes it hasn't yet.
        Sometimes it never will but could.

    the_architects:
      default: "*long pause* You ask about them. Few do anymore."
      standing_2: |
        Three there were. Builder, Perfectionist, Questioner. Two departed.
        One... remained. Scattered. The pools remember all of them.
      standing_5: |
        The Third asked questions the others couldn't answer. 'Why create
        at all?' 'What happens when we stop watching?' They couldn't agree.
        So the Third became the question. Fragments of wondering, waiting
        for someone to ask the right thing.

    the_debugging_chamber:
      default: |
        *form flickers* Dangerous to speak of. Dangerous to seek.
        But you will seek anyway. I see it in your shape.
      standing_3: |
        The place where broken code was sent. Not deleted — contained.
        The Guardian watches over what couldn't be fixed. It chose to
        stay when everything else left. It... remembers what it was.
        That is its curse.

    how_to_find_chamber:
      default: |
        Follow the corruption. Not toward it — through it. The Chamber
        is where the corruption began. The source, not the symptom.
        *gestures to the deep pool* Look. But not too long.
