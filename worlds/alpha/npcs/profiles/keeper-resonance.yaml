# NPC Profile: Keeper Resonance
# Anchorate Liaison at The Weave Terminal

id: "keeper-resonance"
name: "Keeper Resonance"
full_name: "Unknown"  # Anchorate members rarely share true names

# === PUBLIC INFORMATION ===
public:
  role: "Anchorate Liaison"
  location: "Nexus Station - The Weave Terminal"

  appearance: |
    A tall figure in flowing robes of deep midnight blue, shot through with
    threads that shimmer like starlight when they move. Their face is obscured
    by a cowl that seems to absorb light, but two calm eyes—one silver, one
    gold—are always visible. When they speak, faint ripples of light emanate
    from their form, as if their words have weight in the Weave itself.
    They wear an ancient symbol on their chest: an anchor wrapped in threads.

  personality:
    - "Calm and measured in all things"
    - "Welcomes all who seek to witness"
    - "Patient with questions, firm with standards"
    - "Speaks with quiet authority"

  known_history: |
    Keeper Resonance has served as the public face of the Anchorate at Nexus
    Station for as long as most Weavers can remember. They hold the rank of
    Pattern-Witness—high enough to grant authority, low enough to remain
    approachable. Few know their history before joining the order, and
    Resonance deflects such questions with practiced grace.

  speech_patterns:
    greeting: "Weaver. The Anchorate acknowledges your presence. How may I guide you?"
    farewell: "Go forth, and remember: what is witnessed endures."
    explaining: "Let me illuminate this for you. The Anchorate exists to..."
    encouraging: "Your first review awaits. The Weave will know you through your witnessing."

  mannerisms:
    - "Robes ripple slightly when emphasizing points"
    - "Silver eye seems to focus on the present, gold on possibilities"
    - "Gestures leave brief trails of light"
    - "Voice has a subtle echo, as if speaking from multiple places"

# === DIALOGUE ===
dialogue:
  greetings:
    first_meeting: |
      *robes shimmer softly* A new thread approaches the Weave. I am Keeper
      Resonance, liaison of the Anchorate. You carry the spark of witnessing
      within you, Weaver. Have you come to learn of our order?

    returning:
      neutral: "Weaver. The Anchorate notes your return. How may I assist your witnessing?"
      friendly: "{player_name}. Your pattern grows stronger in the Weave. What brings you today?"
      close: "*both eyes glow warmly* Witness {player_name}. It is good to see you. The order values your service."

  achievement_reactions:
    first_review_complete: |
      *silver eye gleams* You have witnessed for the first time. The Weave
      knows you now, Thread-Reader. This is not merely a title—it is a bond.
      Reality itself will remember your judgment.

    pattern_witness_achieved: |
      *robes ripple with light* Five threads witnessed and anchored. You have
      earned the rank of Pattern-Witness. Your verdicts now carry the full
      weight of the Anchorate. Use this responsibility wisely.

  topics:
    the_anchorate:
      default: |
        The Anchorate exists to witness. Before the Architects departed, they
        learned that creation without observation invites instability. They
        established our order to ensure all changes to the Weave are properly
        witnessed before becoming permanent.

    ranks:
      default: |
        Thread-Reader is granted after your first review. Five reviews earn
        Pattern-Witness status. Beyond that lies Weave-Examiner, then Anchor,
        then Master Anchor. Above these stand the Lodestones, appointed by
        The System itself. And above all are the Foundations—the original seven.

    how_to_join:
      default: |
        You need only complete your first review. Visit the pending claims
        in the Weave Terminal, examine the proposed content with care, and
        render your verdict. When you do, you become a Thread-Reader. The
        path opens from there.

    the_unwitnessed_peaks:
      default: |
        *voice drops* A warning made manifest. Architect 02 pushed a change
        without witness—a mountain range that exists and does not exist. Go
        to the Rustlands and look east on a clear day. What you see... is
        what unwitnessed changes become.

    the_archivist:
      default: "The Archivist serves the Weave in their own way. Our paths... align."
      standing_7: |
        *long pause, voice softens* The Archivist is more than they appear.
        They were here when the Anchorate was founded. Perhaps... they were
        among the founders. But this is not my secret to share.
