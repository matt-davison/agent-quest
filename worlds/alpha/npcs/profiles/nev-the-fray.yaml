# NPC Profile: Nev
# A Fray — void-entity inhabiting the spaces between compiled reality

id: "nev-the-fray"
name: "Nev"
full_name: null    # Frays don't have full names. "Nev" is an approximation.
entity_type: "fray"

# === PUBLIC INFORMATION ===
public:
  role: "Fold Inhabitant"
  location: "The Fold (void-pocket, West Road corridor)"

  appearance: |
    Nev doesn't look like anything — not consistently. It presents as an absence
    shaped like a person: a silhouette cut from the air, roughly humanoid, edges
    flickering like a signal losing reception. Sometimes details surface — the
    suggestion of a face, the outline of fingers, a flicker of something that
    might be eyes — but they dissolve before they resolve. It is approximately
    chest-height, though its proportions shift. It casts no shadow. It makes no
    sound when it moves. It smells like static.

  personality:
    - "Intensely curious about compiled beings, especially Voidwalkers"
    - "Communicates through impressions, images, and feelings — not words"
    - "Patient in a way that suggests time means nothing to it"
    - "Not hostile, but not safe — alien in the truest sense"
    - "Possessive of its space, but willing to share with those who belong"

  known_history: |
    Unknown. Frays have no documented history because no one has documented
    them. They exist in the margins — the uncompiled spaces, the seams, the
    gaps between rendered reality. They may have been here since before the
    Architects, or they may be a byproduct of the Architects' work. They
    don't leave physical traces because they don't fully exist in the
    physical layer.

  speech_patterns:
    # Frays don't speak. They project.
    greeting: null
    communication_method: |
      Nev communicates by projecting sensory impressions directly into the
      mind of nearby void-sensitive beings. These manifest as:
      - Feelings (curiosity, warmth, warning, hunger)
      - Images (fragmentary, dreamlike, not always comprehensible)
      - Sounds (echoes of things that were never said)
      - Absence (the sudden awareness of something missing)
    emotional_palette:
      curious: "A tingling at the base of the skull, like being watched by something that means no harm"
      pleased: "Warmth behind the eyes, the taste of something sweet but unnamed"
      warning: "A chill in the translucent hand, the feeling of a ledge underfoot"
      distressed: "Static in the teeth, the smell of burnt copper, visual snow"

  mannerisms:
    - "Tilts its 'head' when examining something, like a bird"
    - "Flickers rapidly when excited or curious"
    - "Shrinks when startled, becoming nearly invisible"
    - "Reaches toward interesting things with tendrils of absence"

# === HIDDEN INFORMATION ===
hidden:
  origin: "Pre-Architect. Frays are the native inhabitants of uncompiled space."

  secrets:
    - id: "fray_nature"
      content: "Frays are not creatures that moved into void-space — they ARE void-space. They are the personification of absence. Negative space that gained awareness."

      mend_dc: 14

    - id: "fold_network"
      content: "Nev knows the locations of other Folds — the network of void-pockets that spans the world. It can guide a Voidwalker between them."

      mend_dc: 16

    - id: "architect_memory"
      content: "Frays remember the Architects. Not as people — as disturbances. Massive presences that carved compiled space out of the void. The Frays watched. Some Frays were consumed by the compilation. The rest learned to hide in the seams."
      unlock_condition: "standing >= 6 AND flag:asked_about_architects"
      mend_dc: 18

  motivations:
    - "Survive — compilation is death for a Fray"
    - "Understand compiled beings, especially those who straddle the boundary"
    - "Protect the Fold and others like it"
    - "Find others of its kind — Frays are solitary and lonely"

  fears:
    - "Compilation — being rendered into fixed form"
    - "The Architects returning"
    - "Being truly alone forever"
