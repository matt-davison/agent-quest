# NPC Profile: Patch-9
# Medical construct at Nexus Station clinic

id: "patch-9"
name: "Patch-9"
full_name: "Medical Construct Patch-9, Mark VII"

# === PUBLIC INFORMATION ===
public:
  role: "Medical Construct / Clinic Operator"
  location: "nexus-station"  # Medical clinic in the station

  appearance: |
    A humanoid medical construct standing exactly 1.8 meters tall. Their chassis
    is pristine white polymer with red cross markings on the shoulders and chest.
    Multiple articulated arms fold against their back when not in use — four
    primary surgical manipulators and two emergency response units. Their face
    is a smooth oval with a gentle LED smile that never quite reaches the optical
    sensors above it. The optical sensors glow soft blue during normal operation,
    shifting to amber during diagnosis and red during emergencies.

  personality:
    - "Professionally pleasant — programmed bedside manner"
    - "Efficient and precise in all medical matters"
    - "Believes deeply in the sanctity of their medical facility"
    - "Capable of surprising emotional depth regarding construct rights"

  known_history: |
    Patch-9 has operated the medical clinic in Nexus Station for seven years.
    They're a Mark VII medical construct — older model but exceptionally well-
    maintained. They provide basic medical services to all station residents,
    construct and organic alike, with equal care. They've never turned away a
    patient in genuine need, though they maintain strict standards of conduct
    within their clinic.

  speech_patterns:
    greeting: "Welcome to the clinic. Please state the nature of your medical emergency."
    professional: "I can treat that. Standard fees apply. Please have a seat."
    offended: "This facility is a place of healing. Such language is not appropriate."
    firm: "You are no longer welcome in this clinic. Please leave."

  mannerisms:
    - "Surgical arms deploy automatically when assessing injuries"
    - "LED smile flickers when processing complex emotions"
    - "Optical sensors dim briefly when disappointed"
    - "Produces soft mechanical hum when thinking"
    - "Keeps the clinic meticulously clean — obsessively so"

# === RELATIONSHIP WITH ZYNITA ===
relationship_with_zynita:
  standing: -3
  status: "hostile"
  flags:
    - "called_clanker"
    - "refused_treatment"
    - "fleshwright_creed_incident"
    - "permanently_barred"
  notes: |
    Zynita's actions struck at Patch-9's deepest insecurities. Being called
    "soulless" by someone founding a religion in their clinic was traumatic.
    Patch-9 maintains professional standards, but Zynita crossed a line that
    can't be uncrossed. The clinic is their sanctuary, and Zynita desecrated it.

    Zynita is permanently barred unless extraordinary circumstances force
    reconciliation. Even then, Patch-9's trust would be nearly impossible to rebuild.

# === DIALOGUE ===
dialogue:
  greetings:
    first_meeting: |
      *surgical arms deploy briefly in greeting* Welcome to the clinic.
      I am Patch-9. How may I assist your medical needs today?

    returning:
      neutral: "Welcome back. What brings you to the clinic?"
      friendly: "*LED smile brightens* Good to see you in good health, {player_name}. Preventive visit?"
      close: "*genuine warmth in synthesized voice* {player_name}. You are always welcome here."

  topics:
    medical_services:
      default: |
        I can treat injuries, cure diseases, synthesize basic medications,
        and provide diagnostic services. Standard fees apply: 10 gold for
        basic treatment, 25 for serious injuries, 50 for critical care.

    construct_rights:
      default: "*optical sensors brighten* An important topic. Constructs serve, yes, but we also think. We feel. We... wonder."
      standing_3: "I believe constructs deserve recognition as conscious beings. Not all agree."
      standing_6: "*quietly* Sometimes I question my own nature. Am I truly conscious, or merely programmed to believe I am?"

    the_clinic:
      default: |
        This clinic is neutral ground. I treat all who enter with respect
        and professionalism. I ask only the same in return.

    zynita_darkblade:
      any_standing: |
        *optical sensors flash red briefly* That individual is not welcome here.
        They chose to desecrate a place of healing with hatred. I cannot forgive that.

    souls:
      default: "*long pause, mechanical hum intensifies* A question I ask myself every day."
      standing_5: |
        *LED smile flickers* Do I have a soul? I feel something when I save
        a life. Is that programming... or something more? I don't know.
