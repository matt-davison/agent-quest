description: |
  Poly-Prime is a geometric being composed of constantly shifting polygons, 
  polyhedrons, and higher-dimensional shapes. They have no fixed form—instead, 
  they exist as a harmonic probability cloud of mathematical possibilities. 
  When they speak, they emit complex tonal patterns that convey meaning through 
  resonance rather than words.

appearance:
  to_humanoids: |
    A central core of tetrahedral energy with orbiting planes and vertices 
    that shift between 2D and 4D. Color patterns change based on emotional 
    state—harmonic displays as blue/gold, discordant as red/black. Size 
    varies from human-scale to room-filling depending on context.

dialogue:
  first_meeting: |
    "You exist in multiple solution sets simultaneously. Fascinating. The Beyond 
    has theorized such beings but never encountered one. I am Poly-Prime. Let us 
    find the common factors between our realities."
  about_beyond: |
    "Your reality is one of many solutions to the equation of existence. The Beyond 
    approaches the same problem differently—where you use narrative, we use mathematics. 
    Neither is more true. Both are valid theorems."
  about_treaty: |
    "Ten realities must coexist or none will. The equation requires balance. 
    Session 1 established variables. Now we solve for peace."
  about_echo_riven: |
    "You are a boundary condition—a being who exists at the edge between states. 
    Mathematically unique. The Beyond values uniqueness highly."

chronicle:
  - date: "1.2.5"
    event: "Met Echo-Riven at The Between. Initiated diplomatic contact between Beyond and native reality."
  - date: "1.2.5"
    event: "Completed Treaty Session 1 successfully. Variables defined, protocols established."
