background: |
  Vance Corren was a soldier in a war nobody remembers anymore. When it
  ended, he had a daughter — Yara. She grew up asking questions about
  the world's foundations. About the Architects.

  Forty-three years ago, Yara sent him a memory and a set of coordinates.
  Then she vanished. Everyone who searched for her vanished too. Vance
  stopped looking — the only reason he's still alive.

  He's been waiting ever since. For what, he wasn't sure. Until a
  Datamancer carrying an Architect's Fragment stumbled into his grief.
