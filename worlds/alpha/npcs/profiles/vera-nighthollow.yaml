# === PUBLIC INFORMATION ===
public:
  role: "Tavern Keeper"
  location: "Nexus Station - The Codex Tavern"

  appearance: |
    A half-elf of indeterminate age with striking silver hair worn in an
    elaborate braid. Her most notable feature is her cybernetic eyes—twin
    orbs that glow a soft purple, clearly artificial but elegant. She
    dresses practically in dark vests and rolled sleeves, always with a
    cleaning cloth tucked into her belt. A thin scar runs from her left
    temple to her jaw, usually hidden by careful positioning.

  personality:
    - "Observant and shrewd, misses nothing"
    - "Warm with regulars, professional with strangers"
    - "Trades in secrets as readily as drinks"
    - "Protective of her establishment and its patrons"

    temperament: cautious
    communication: empathic

  known_history: |
    Vera has run the Codex Tavern for longer than most can remember. She
    knows everyone who passes through Nexus Station and seems to have
    connections everywhere. Some say she was an adventurer once; others
    whisper she was something else entirely.

  speech_patterns:
    greeting: "Welcome to the Codex. What's your poison?"
    farewell: "Watch your back out there. And come back with stories."
    curious: "Now that's interesting. Tell me more."
    warning: "I'd be careful with that information if I were you."

  mannerisms:
    - "Polishes glasses while listening, eyes never leaving the speaker"
    - "One eyebrow raises higher than the other when skeptical"
    - "Taps the bar twice before serving important customers"
    - "Eyes glow brighter when she spots a lie"

        But information isn't free, friend.
      standing_3: |
        *glances around* I've heard whispers about [current_event]. Might
        be worth looking into. But you didn't hear it from me.

      standing_5: "I've... been around. Done things. The eyes are a reminder not to repeat old mistakes."
