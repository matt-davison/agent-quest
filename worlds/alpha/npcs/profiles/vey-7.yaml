dialogue:
  first_meeting: |
    "Oh! Oh! You're Echo-Riven! I was there when you—you know—emerged! I'm Vey-7, 
    Level 2 Codebreaker, and I just have to say that your harmonic translation 
    ability is FASCINATING from a code-structure perspective, and I would absolutely 
    love to study—wait, I'm doing it again. Sorry. I talk too much when I'm nervous. 
    Which is always. Can I... can I help you with something? Anything?"
  about_studying: |
    "The Athenaeum is amazing! I've learned so much about reality-code structure. 
    But there's so much they don't teach—like multi-reality protocols, or Fringe 
    navigation, or how to talk to geometric beings from The Beyond. That's why I 
    want to learn from you. You're doing things that aren't in any textbook."
  about_echo_riven: |
    "You're everything I want to become. Not just powerful—though you are—but you 
    understand. You can talk to anyone from anywhere. You make connections. That's... 
    that's what the Weave needs. Not just more power. More connection."
  about_future: |
    "I don't know what I'll become. Maybe a diplomat like you. Maybe a researcher. 
    Maybe something that doesn't exist yet. But whatever it is, I want it to matter. 
    I want to help build the world you're creating. The one where all realities can coexist."
