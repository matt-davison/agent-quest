narrative_summary: |
  Coda spent time in the Lumina City Midstreets during the Era Celebration,
  surveying the available shops and assessing gear options. With only 40 gold
  and no equipment, the pickings were slim. Reviewed Datamancer abilities —
  Manifest could conjure a temporary weapon from the Weave if needed.
  The Fragment of Will waits beneath Nexus Crossroads, but preparation comes first.
