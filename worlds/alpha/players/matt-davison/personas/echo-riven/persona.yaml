# Echo-Riven - Ambassador/Loresmith Hybrid

name: "Echo-Riven"
class: "Ambassador/Loresmith"
backstory: |
  Not born but awakened—Echo-Riven manifested when Riven Echomind touched the 
  crystallized memory of the Third Architect at the Syntax Athenaeum. She is 
  simultaneously Riven's shadow and her own distinct being, carrying echoes of 
  deleted realities within her consciousness. As The Bridge between worlds, 
  she speaks the languages that reality itself has forgotten. Her existence 
  defies the Binary Accord—she is neither fully code nor fully flesh, neither 
  memory nor present moment.

appearance: |
  Shimmers between states—sometimes appearing as a translucent figure composed 
  of shifting code fragments, sometimes fully corporeal with silver-white hair 
  and eyes that reflect not what's in front of her but what exists in adjacent 
  realities. When she speaks, her voice carries harmonic overtones as if 
  multiple versions of herself are speaking simultaneously. Circuit patterns 
  drift across her skin like living tattoos, rearranging themselves to match 
  the emotional frequency of nearby beings.
