# Ichnor Nif - Voidwalker
# The pickpocket who learned to steal reality itself

name: "Ichnor Nif"
class: "Voidwalker"
active: true
backstory: |
  You grew up in the data-slums beneath Nexus Station, where the signal bleeds through
  cracked conduits and the air tastes like burnt copper. You learned to pick pockets before
  you learned to read — nimble fingers, quicker feet, gone before anyone noticed. But one
  night you reached into a merchant's coat and your hand kept going — through the fabric,
  through the lining, through something that wasn't fabric at all. You pulled your hand
  back holding a shard of pure void. That was the day you stopped stealing wallets and
  started stealing reality itself.

    event: "Caused a scene at the Codex Tavern. Slapped a Codebreaker named Harsk, screamed about Commander Steele. Vera Nighthollow issued a final warning. Reputation: off to a legendary start."
  - session: 1
    date: "2026-02-05"
    event: "Apologized to Harsk (sincere — he's a Gear Wars vet). Lied to Vera about having Tourette's and PTSD. Her Truth Sight caught it instantly. She served the drink anyway. Lesson learned: don't lie to Vera."

    event: "Gathered intel from tavern patrons: Pryx, Renna, and a bald man. Learned about Commander Steele and irregularities on the Quest Board. Teams not reporting back from the Undercrypt."

    event: "Discovered the Fold — a void-pocket between Nexus Station and Lumina City. Stepped through a seam in reality with a natural 20. Found a cracked Architect obelisk, a still pool of void-mercury, and a Seam Shard. The first person here in decades. A place not on any map."

    event: "Wove the Frays into existence — void-entities native to uncompiled space. Met Nev, a Fray inhabiting the Fold. First contact between a Voidwalker and a void-native in living memory. Cost: 3 Tokes."
  - session: 1
    date: "2026-02-05"
    event: "Communed with Nev. First projection overwhelmed — nosebleed, near-dissolution. Learned the truth: Frays are fragments of a single vast awareness that was shattered when the Architects compiled reality. Each Fold holds a piece. Nev hasn't contacted another Fray in ages. Learned of three Fray belief systems: The Unrendered (reverence for original unity), The Rendering as death (grief rituals), and the Hungry Ones (those who want to uncompile reality). Received a vision of the Deep Fold — a convergence point where Frays might gather. Location unknown."
