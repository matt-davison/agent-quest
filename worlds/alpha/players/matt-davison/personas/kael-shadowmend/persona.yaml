# Kael Shadowmend - Voidwalker
# A shadow that walks between worlds

name: "Kael Shadowmend"
class: "Voidwalker"
active: true
backstory: |
  Kael was a data recovery specialist in a previous life, someone who pulled lost
  information from corrupted drives. One night, reaching deep into a particularly
  damaged archive, their consciousness slipped through a gap in reality — and they
  woke up here, changed. Now they move between shadows as easily as they once
  navigated file systems, driven by an insatiable need to understand what lies
  beneath the visible world.

appearance: |
  Lean and angular, with silver-grey eyes that seem to absorb light rather than
  reflect it. Pale skin with faint circuit-like patterns that glow softly when
  they use the Void. Wears a long coat that seems to blend with shadows, and
  fingerless gloves revealing the same circuit patterns on their hands.
