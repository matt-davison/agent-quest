# Riven Echomind - Loresmith

name: "Riven Echomind"
class: "Loresmith"
backstory: |
  Riven awoke to the Weave in the dusty archives of a forgotten library, surrounded by books
  that no longer existed in any database. A former digital archivist, they'd spent years
  cataloging data that corporations wanted erased. When they touched a corrupted memory crystal,
  reality fractured—and they saw the code beneath. Now they seek the lost knowledge of the
  First Architects, collecting fragments of deleted history that the Weave itself has forgotten.

appearance: |
  Tall and wiry, with silver-streaked black hair pulled into a messy bun. Wears a long coat
  covered in data-chip pockets and memory patches. Their eyes constantly shimmer with reflected
  light, as if reading invisible text. Cybernetic tattoos trace circuits across their temples,
  pulsing softly when accessing memories.
