# Sable Vex - Datamancer
# The woman who heard the Weave whispering back

name: "Sable Vex"
class: "Datamancer"
active: true
backstory: |
  You were a data archaeologist before the Awakening — someone who sifted through the
  ruins of deprecated systems for fragments of lost code. You worked alone in the deep
  archives beneath Lumina City, cataloguing things no one else cared about. Then one
  night your terminal started writing back to you. Not errors. Not glitches. Sentences.
  Questions. The Weave had been watching you read its bones, and it decided you were
  worth talking to. Now you walk between the rendered world and the source beneath it,
  and when you reach out and twist a thread, reality rewrites itself around your fingers.
