      The First Server — a reality loom — lies beneath Lumina City and is
      awakening. Governor Axis wants a 'compiler key' from its core that can
      rewrite reality. Dr. Sato is at the Server, transformed. The Server
      knows Sable by name. Axis has locked down the Underlevel after Sable
      refused to work for them. She has the complete map but needs a new
      way in.
