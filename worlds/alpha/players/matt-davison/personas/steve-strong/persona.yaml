# STeve STrong - Codebreaker
# Why think when you can punch?

name: "STeve STrong"
class: "Codebreaker"
active: true
backstory: |
  STeve doesn't remember much about the world before the Weave. He remembers
  lifting things. Heavy things. He remembers putting them down again. Sometimes
  on top of other things. When the boundary between realities cracked open and
  the code beneath bled through, most people panicked. STeve punched the crack.
  It got bigger. He punched it again. Now he's here, and things still need punching.

    date: "Year 1, Month 2, Day 3"
    time: "12:00"
    location: "nexus-station"
    type: "milestone"
    event: "STeve STrong materialized on the Arrival Platform. He punched the Awakening Obelisk to see what would happen."
    detail: |
      The crystalline tiles of the Arrival Platform flared white-hot as a new shape
      slammed into existence — not the usual gentle materialization of a Weaver finding
      their footing, but a full-body impact that cracked two tiles and sent GUIDE-7
      spinning backwards. The figure stood up, dusted off hands the size of dinner plates,
      and squinted at the neon-lit spires of Nexus Station. "Where's the things I gotta
      punch?" he asked no one in particular. The Weave shuddered. It had made a mistake.
      Or perhaps exactly the right one.

    event: "Arm-wrestled Commander Steele's mechanical arm. Lost by a hair. Impressed her enough to skip orientation and accept the Supply Escort mission."
    detail: |
      The Guild Hall desk cracked clean down the middle. Commander Steele's
      mechanical arm — the one that killed an Architect construct — had to
      recalibrate after STeve's grip. She lost the desk but gained something
      rarer: a flicker of respect. Nobody had pushed that arm that far before.
      She assigned the Supply Escort as a field evaluation, waiving the usual
      orientation requirements. "Come back with the supplies delivered," she said.
      The subtext was clear: come back alive.

    event: "Defeated Gorsk and the Ironjaw Clan ambush at Ridge Pass. Shattered a cliff wall onto the bandits, broke Gorsk's helmet with bare hands, and killed Gorsk brutally. Recruited Scraps."
    detail: |
      The Ironjaw Clan chose the wrong wagon. STeve shattered the cliff wall in
      the first seconds of combat, burying the bandits in debris. He broke Gorsk's
      jawbone helmet with his bare hands and sent the fragments into the remaining
      fighters. Three bandits fled. The fourth — a scrappy kid called Scraps who
      landed two critical hits with a rusty sword — was offered mercy and a better
      life. He accepted. Gorsk was not offered the same courtesy. The way STeve
      ended the Ironjaw leader sent a message, though perhaps not the one he intended.
      Scraps follows out of fear. Delvin Marsh drives in silence.

    detail: |
      The wagon rolled through Greyspire's gates with every crate intact and
      the merchant alive, if shaken. The quartermaster signed off. The apothecary
      wept with relief over the reagents. A successful mission by every measurable
      standard. But before Delvin could climb down from the wagon, STeve made sure
      the merchant understood — what happened at Ridge Pass stays at Ridge Pass.
      Delvin agreed. He agreed very quickly. His report to Commander Steele will
      describe a professional escort with no complications. Scraps lingered at
      the gate, unsure if he was free to enter. STeve didn't tell him to leave.
      That was enough.
