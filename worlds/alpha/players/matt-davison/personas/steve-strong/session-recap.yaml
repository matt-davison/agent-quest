narrative_summary: |
  STeve STrong materialized at Nexus Station with nothing but 23 Strength and
  a burning need to punch things. He skipped orientation entirely, arm-wrestled
  Commander Steele's mechanical arm (lost by one point), and impressed her enough
  to earn a field evaluation: escort a supply wagon to Outpost Greyspire. On the
  road, the Ironjaw Clan ambushed the convoy at Ridge Pass. STeve shattered a
  cliff wall onto the bandits, broke Gorsk's jawbone helmet with his bare hands,
  and killed the bandit leader in a brutal fashion. He recruited a scrappy bandit
  named Scraps and intimidated the merchant Delvin Marsh into silence. Supplies
  delivered. Level 2 reached. The Rustlands frontier awaits.
