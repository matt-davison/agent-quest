# Zynita Darkblade — Voidwalker

name: "Zynita Darkblade"
class: "Voidwalker"
active: true

backstory: |
  Zynita grew up running skolma for the Pale Circuit in the flooded tunnels
  beneath Nexus Station — until she sampled her own supply and the drug tore
  open her perception, letting her see the gaps between reality's threads.
  When the Circuit's enforcers came to collect their cut, she panicked and
  phased straight through three walls and a security grid, leaving them
  grasping at shadows. Now she works freelance, taking dangerous jobs and
  seeking the next high — always chasing that first moment when the Weave split
  open and showed her its secrets, never quite reaching it again.

appearance: |
  Standing at just 4'11", Zynita is easy to underestimate — a mistake her
  enemies rarely make twice. Electric blue hair in a choppy undercut frames
  sharp features, a silver septum ring glimmering when she phases. Full
  sleeves of anime tattoos cover both arms — characters from pre-Collapse
  serials that seem to shift and animate when viewed through Weave-sight.
  Her notably large feet are always clad in oversized combat boots that
  somehow never slow her down. She jokes the void needs good anchors.
