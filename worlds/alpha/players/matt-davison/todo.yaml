    description: "Add world setting to disable user-generated content"
    context: any
    notes: |
      Add a world-level setting (e.g. user_generation: disabled) that
      prevents players from dictating world content. When disabled:
      - Do NOT accept user suggestions about how the world works
      - Do NOT let users tell you what exists or what is happening
      - The AI drives all world content: NPCs, locations, lore, events
      - Players are restricted to performing actions only (MOVE, TALK,
        FIGHT, USE, etc.) — not authoring the world
      This makes the game feel like a proper RPG where the DM is in charge.

    description: "Add politics system for city influence"
    context: any
    notes: |
      Create a politics system where players can gain influence over
      city-type locations. Design should include:
      - Influence mechanics (how players gain/lose political power)
      - City governance structures (mayor, council, factions, etc.)
      - What influence lets you do (pass laws, set taxes, control NPCs,
        shape city development, unlock exclusive quests)
      - Requires owning a home in the city (see todo-014)
      - Multiple players can compete for influence in the same city

    description: "Add home ownership system"
    context: any
    notes: |
      Create a home system with these rules:
      - Each persona can own multiple homes
      - Every home is tied to a specific location
      - Only one home per location per persona
      - Owning a home at a city location is required to participate
        in that city's politics system (todo-013)
      - Homes could have upgrades, storage, decoration, etc.
      - Track homes in persona YAML (e.g. homes: [{location, name, ...}])

    description: "Make the TODO system be per-persona, not per-player"
    context: any
    notes: |
      Currently the TODO system is per-player, not per-persona. This means that if a player has multiple personas, they will all share the same TODO list. This is not ideal. The TODO system should be something that can be used to guide autopilot sessions for a persona.

    description: "Find Fragment of Will under Nexus Crossroads"
    context: "coda"
    notes: |
      Vance Corren confirmed the Fragment of Will is beneath Nexus Crossroads.
      WARNING: Something lives in those shadows, and it remembers what it swallowed.
      Prepare for a dangerous encounter — may need equipment and full willpower.
      This is Fragment 2 of 3 for The Third Architect quest.

    description: "Follow Yara's Coordinates — investigate her last known location"
    context: "coda"
    notes: |
      Yara Corren vanished 43 years ago hunting Architect 03.
      Her father Vance gave Coda a data chip with her last coordinates.
      This could reveal what happened to her and unlock deeper quest lore.
      Item: Yara's Coordinates (dsyp6f6f) in inventory.

    context: "coda"
    notes: |
      Coda has NO weapon, armor, or accessory equipped. 40 gold available.
      Check shops in Lumina City: Ammo Dump, Stitch & Co, Black Market.
      At minimum need a weapon before facing whatever lurks beneath Nexus.

    description: "Spend unspent stat point from reaching level 2"
    context: "coda"
    notes: |
      1 unspent stat point from level 2. Consider where to invest:
      - Mind (17): Boosts Datamancer spell power
      - Spirit (18): Increases willpower pool
      - Agility (10): Helps with initiative and dodging
      - Strength (10): Melee damage, but not Coda's style

    description: "Find Fragment of Vision in Oracle's Hollow"
    context: "coda"
    notes: |
      Session 6 discovery placed Fragment of Vision in Oracle's Hollow.
      This is Fragment 3 of 3 for The Third Architect quest.
      Oracle's Hollow location may need to be woven into existence first.

    notes: |
      The Broker of Threads gave Coda a token to present to Korvax.
      Item: Broker's Token (x63kh0ob) in inventory.
      Could unlock special arena opportunities or information.

    description: "Weave Oracle's Hollow into existence"
    context: "coda"
    notes: |
      Oracle's Hollow is where Fragment of Vision is located.
      This location needs to be created — a great weaving opportunity.
      Should tie into Architect lore and have its own NPCs/encounters.

    context: any
    notes: |
      NPCs like Vera Nighthollow, GUIDE-7, Dean Overflow, Madame Ling,
      Vance Corren, and Pit Boss Korvax could use more detailed histories.
      Generate this organically through gameplay interactions.
