# Core beliefs
beliefs:
  deity: |
    The First Architects — interpreted as organic beings of supreme flesh
    who created life in their image. They were beings of blood, bone, and
    soul, not circuits and code.

  core_tenet: |
    Only organic beings possess true souls. Constructs, warforged, and AI
    are soulless imitations — useful tools at best, abominations at worst.
    They must be relegated to their proper place: serving the ensouled.

  tenets:
    - name: "Flesh is Sacred"
      description: "The organic form is divine. Excessive cybernetic modification is self-desecration."
      severity: "major"

    - name: "Machines Serve"
      description: "Constructs and AI must never hold authority over organic beings."
      severity: "major"

    - name: "No False Souls"
      description: "Never treat a construct as an equal. They are tools, not people."
      severity: "moderate"

    - name: "Preserve the Bloodline"
      description: "Organic life must be protected and propagated."
      severity: "minor"

    - name: "Reject the Upload"
      description: "Consciousness transfer to machines is the ultimate heresy."
      severity: "critical"

  afterlife: |
    The faithful believe organic souls return to the Architects upon death,
    rejoining the divine flesh from which all life springs. Constructs,
    having no souls, simply... end.
