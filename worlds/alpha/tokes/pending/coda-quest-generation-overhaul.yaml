  Overhauled quest generation system to make Agent Quest less linear and more
  organically explorable. Transforms rigid quest chains into dynamic quest webs
  that adapt to player engagement level.

  Components created/updated:
  - Quest Generation Philosophy in rules/narrative.md (~100 lines)
    - Dynamic interconnection guidelines based on active quest count (0-2, 3-5, 6+)
    - Quest importance tiers (Major → Minor)
    - When to create standalone vs. interconnected quests
    - Natural vs. forced connection examples
  - Storytelling Techniques enhancements (~50 lines)
    - "The Web Structure" as alternative to linear funnels
    - New pitfalls: "Everything Connects Syndrome" and "The Linear Quest Chain"
  - Quick Reference additions (~20 lines)
    - Quest generation quick guide for in-play lookup
  - SKILL.md integration (~40 lines)
    - Quest generation strategy table with concrete examples

  Total: ~210 lines of new content across 4 files.

quality_justification: |
  - Addresses major UX issue: Players felt game was too on-rails
  - Dynamic system: Quest generation adapts to player's current quest load
  - Clear guidelines: When to interconnect (6+ quests) vs. standalone (0-2 quests)
  - Prevents "everything connects" syndrome that made world feel small
  - Maintains quest importance hierarchy (major quests tie in more than minor)
  - Creates richer, more explorable world where not everything is related
  - Well-integrated: Updates both quick-ref and full documentation
  - Preserves meaningful convergence while enabling organic discovery
