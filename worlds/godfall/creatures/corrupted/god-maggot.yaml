description: |
  Pale, bloated larvae the size of warhorses, burrowing through the
  decaying flesh of dead gods. Their translucent skin reveals churning
  golden ichor within. They have no eyes, navigating by vibration and
  the scent of divine meat. Their mouths are circular pits of grinding
  teeth designed to tear through god-flesh — mortal armor is nothing to
  them. They are not aggressive by nature, preferring to feed, but they
  are territorial and will attack anything that disturbs their meal.
  The ichor in their bodies makes them toxic to the touch, and when
  killed, they burst in a spray of half-digested divine matter.

encounter_notes: |
  God-Maggots are territorial brutes found primarily on and around
  divine corpses. They are not aggressive unless disturbed.

  Combat patterns:
  - Attacks anything that enters feeding territory
  - Uses Grinding Bite as primary attack (degrades armor)
  - Sprays ichor when multiple targets cluster
  - Burrows for ambush on god-corpse terrain
  - Explodes on death — ranged killing is safer

  Key vulnerabilities:
  - Extremely flammable due to ichor saturation
  - Slow and predictable
  - Will flee if badly hurt and not cornered
  - Slashing weapons cut easily through soft body
  - Can be avoided entirely by not entering feeding territory
