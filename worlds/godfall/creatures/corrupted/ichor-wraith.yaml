description: |
  A shimmering, translucent figure wreathed in golden mist — the color of
  divine blood. Ichor Wraiths coalesce where god-blood pools in sufficient
  concentration, forming spectral shapes that echo the agony of the dying
  gods. They have no true form, shifting between vaguely humanoid shapes
  and formless clouds of toxic vapor. Their touch burns with the fire of
  divine corruption, and the air around them reeks of the sweet, cloying
  stench of ichor. Where they pass, the ground stains gold and nothing
  grows for years.

encounter_notes: |
  Ichor Wraiths are dangerous, mobile threats that ignore armor and
  inflict lasting corruption.

  Combat patterns:
  - Phase Shifts to reach high-value targets
  - Uses Ichor Touch to bypass armor
  - Disperses into Golden Mist when surrounded or low on HP
  - Gravitates toward ichor pools for healing

  Key vulnerabilities:
  - Cold damage crystallizes them, making them solid and targetable
  - Spirit damage disrupts their divine echo core
  - Ichor Wards repel them, forcing them to choose other targets
  - Cannot maintain Golden Mist and attack simultaneously
