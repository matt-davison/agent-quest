  Where the divine rot is thickest, where ichor pools deep and god-flesh
  decays in mountains, the corruption sometimes coalesces into something
  with intent. The Rot Heralds are towering figures of putrefied divine
  matter — ten feet tall, vaguely humanoid, draped in robes of rotting
  god-skin. Their faces are smooth and featureless except for a single
  crack that splits the head vertically, from which golden light pours.
  They do not speak, but they sing — a low, resonant hum that drives
  mortals mad and accelerates the spread of divine rot. They are not
  undead. They are not alive. They are the wasteland itself given form
  and terrible purpose.

encounter_notes: |
  Rot Heralds are the apex predators of the wasteland. They are rare,
  powerful, and terrifying. Each one guards a region of deep corruption.

  Combat patterns:
  - Opens with Herald's Song to pull enemies close
  - Creates ichor pools with Geyser for terrain control and self-healing
  - Uses Rot Strike against adjacent enemies (heavy damage + rot)
  - Rot Aura punishes melee fighters without Ichor Wards
  - Reconstitutes when nearly destroyed — MUST be burned or purified

  Key vulnerabilities:
  - Fire is devastatingly effective
  - Purifying abilities (if available) bypass all resistances
  - Keep distance to avoid Rot Aura and Herald's Song
  - Destroy the ichor pool during Reconstitute to prevent reformation
  - Ichor Wards negate the passive Rot Aura damage

  Encounter design:
  - Usually found alone near major ichor concentrations
  - Terrain should include at least one ichor pool
  - Bone piles nearby allow it to summon reinforcements
  - Consider providing Ichor Ward access before this fight
