name: "Bone Shambler"
category: undead
tier: minion
level: 1

description: |
  A rattling mass of bones held together by residual divine energy — not
  a single skeleton but dozens fused into a lurching, multi-limbed horror.
  Arms jut at wrong angles. Skulls of different races stare from its torso.
  It moves in a clattering, uneven gait, dragging itself forward with whatever
  limbs touch the ground. These things rise spontaneously from the Bonefield
  where the divine energy seeping from god-corpses animates the millions of
  war dead. They are not intelligent. They are barely aware. But they are
  relentless, and they are everywhere.

encounter_notes: |
  Bone Shamblers are the most common threat in the outer wasteland.
  Individually weak, they are dangerous in numbers.

  Combat patterns:
  - Shamble toward nearest living creature
  - Attack mindlessly until destroyed
  - Explode on death (Bone Burst)
  - May reassemble if not properly destroyed

  Key vulnerabilities:
  - Bludgeoning weapons shatter them permanently
  - Fire destroys the divine residue that animates them
  - Slow and clumsy — easily kited by mobile characters
  - No tactics whatsoever
