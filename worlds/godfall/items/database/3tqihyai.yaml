description: |
  A battered brass compass salvaged from a warship's navigation station.
  Its needle doesn't point north — it points away from the strongest
  nearby source of divine corruption. In the wasteland, that means it
  points toward safer ground. Experienced scavengers swear by them.
  When the needle spins wildly, it means corruption is everywhere and
  you should leave. Immediately.
