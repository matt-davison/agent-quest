description: |
  A leather roll containing essential scavenging tools: a small pry bar,
  wire cutters, a hand drill, pliers, and various picks. Also includes
  sealed vials for safe ichor collection and thick gloves for handling
  contaminated objects. Every scavenger in the Gray Margin carries one.
  Losing yours in the wasteland is considered worse luck than meeting
  a Rot Herald.
