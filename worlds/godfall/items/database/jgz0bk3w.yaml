description: |
  A shard of bone from a dead god. Heavier than it should be, warm to
  the touch, and faintly luminous. Celestial bone is harder than any
  mortal metal and resonates with divine energy. Master crafters can
  forge it into weapons and armor of extraordinary power, though
  working the material requires tools and knowledge most have lost.
  Holding it too long without protection causes headaches and visions.
