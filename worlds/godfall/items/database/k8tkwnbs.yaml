description: |
  A water-damaged journal recovered from a dead war-mage's pack. The
  pages describe a combat technique developed during the war: channeling
  ambient divine energy into a focused lance of corrupted power. The
  spell turns the enemy's own poison against them. Reading it with
  intent burns the pattern into the caster's memory. The pages then
  dissolve into golden dust.
