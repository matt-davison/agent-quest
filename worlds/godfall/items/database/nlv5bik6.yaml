description: |
  A crude amulet crafted from bonesteel wire and a sliver of crystallized
  ichor, sealed in resin. Sylwen the Ash-Touched developed these after
  months of research into divine corruption. The crystallized ichor at
  its center has been alchemically neutralized, creating a resonance that
  repels active ichor. The protection is not absolute — concentrated
  divine attacks can still harm the wearer — but it prevents the slow,
  creeping poisoning that kills most who enter the deep wasteland.
