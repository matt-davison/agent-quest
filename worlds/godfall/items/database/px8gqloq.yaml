description: |
  A small vial of pure divine ichor, sealed with wax and prayer. The
  golden liquid within pulses with a faint heartbeat. Drinking it floods
  the body with divine energy, massively amplifying spiritual power —
  but the corruption is immediate and severe. Many scavengers have died
  chasing the high of godblood. Those who survive speak of visions:
  the face of the god whose blood they drank, screaming in the dark.
