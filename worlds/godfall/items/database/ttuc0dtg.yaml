description: |
  Plate armor assembled from salvaged warship hull plating. Dented,
  scarred, and bearing the faded insignia of the United Mortal Fleet,
  it is ugly but functional. The arcane-hardened metal that once
  shielded ships from divine fire still offers excellent protection.
  Too heavy for extended travel but invaluable in a fight.
