description: |
  A longsword forged from bonesteel — an alloy smelted from the bones
  of the war dead, mixed with scavenged metal from shattered warships.
  The blade has a faint gray-white sheen and is unnervingly light.
  Bonesteel resonates with the energy that animates the undead, making
  it devastatingly effective against Bone Shamblers and their ilk.
  Crafting these weapons is considered disrespectful by some and
  necessary by most.
