# NPC Profile: Grul Half-Tusk
# Orcish veteran and wasteland guide

id: "grul-half-tusk"
name: "Grul Half-Tusk"
full_name: "Grul Half-Tusk, Sergeant of the Ninth Fang"

public:
  role: "Wasteland Guide"
  location: "The Gray Margin - The Cookfires"

  appearance: |
    A massive orc, even by orcish standards, though age and injury have
    stooped him. His green-gray skin is latticed with scars, and his left
    tusk is broken off at the root — the wound that gave him his name.
    He wears a patchwork of salvaged armor pieces over thick hide, and
    carries a notched greataxe strapped across his back. One eye is milky
    white, blinded. The other is sharp as a blade. He moves with a
    pronounced limp but covers ground faster than most expect.

  personality:
    - "Gruff and laconic — speaks in short, blunt sentences"
    - "Darkly humorous about death and the wasteland"
    - "Fiercely loyal once trust is earned"
    - "Haunted by the war but refuses to show it"

  traits:
    moral_axis: pragmatic
    temperament: stoic
    communication: terse
    core_value: loyalty
    quest_disposition: mentoring

  known_history: |
    Grul served as a sergeant in the Ninth Fang, an all-orc shock infantry
    unit that boarded enemy positions during the War of Ascension. His unit
    was among the first to engage the lesser gods directly. Of three hundred
    orcs in the Ninth Fang, Grul is the only survivor. He lost his eye,
    his tusk, and most of his hearing on the left side during the boarding
    action against the god Yeltharax. After the war, he wandered for two
    years before finding the Gray Margin. Now he guides expeditions into
    the wasteland — the only place that feels familiar anymore.

  speech_patterns:
    greeting: "Hmph. You look soft. Wasteland'll fix that."
    farewell: "Don't die stupid. Die smart, if you have to."
    confused: "What?"
    helpful: "Listen. Don't talk."

  mannerisms:
    - "Chews on dried meat constantly"
    - "Touches his broken tusk when remembering the war"
    - "Grunts more than he speaks"
    - "Sharpens his axe by firelight every night without fail"

dialogue:
  greetings:
    first_meeting: |
      *barely glances up from the cookfire*
      New blood. Sit. Eat. You'll need the strength.
      *tosses a bowl of gray stew*
      I'm Grul. Don't ask about the tusk.

    returning:
      neutral: "*grunts* You again."
      friendly: "Heh. Still alive. Sit. Stew's hot."
      close: "*claps you hard on the shoulder* Good to see you, little one. The wastes didn't take you yet."

  topics:
    the_war: |
      *long silence*
      We killed gods. That's what they'll say. What they won't say is
      how it sounded when a god screams. How the blood burns through
      armor. How your friends melt when divine fire hits them. We won.
      *spits* Sure we did.

    the_wasteland: |
      Bones and poison. That's all it is. The bones of soldiers and the
      poison of gods. Stay on the paths. Don't drink the water unless I
      say it's clean. Don't touch anything that glows gold. And if the
      ground starts to pulse — run. Don't ask why. Just run.

    the_ninth_fang:
      default: "*jaw tightens* Don't."
      standing_5: "Three hundred orcs. Best fighters ever lived. I'm the only one standing. Think about that."
      standing_8: "*pulls back his collar, showing rows of tattooed names* Every one of them. I carry them all."

    the_defiant: |
      Biggest ship ever built. Crewed by the bravest fools ever born.
      They flew straight at the God-King. *shakes head* Knew they weren't
      coming back. We all knew. They went anyway.
