# Expedition Commander at The Gray Margin

id: "marta-ironveil"
name: "Marta Ironveil"
full_name: "Commander Marta Ironveil"

public:
  role: "Expedition Commander"
  location: "The Gray Margin - Ironveil's Command Tent"

  appearance: |
    A tall, broad-shouldered human woman in her late forties. Her face is
    weathered and scarred, with deep lines around her mouth and eyes that
    speak of hard years. Her dark hair is shot through with gray, cropped
    short and practical. She wears battered plate armor over a quilted
    gambeson, both bearing the faded insignia of the United Mortal Fleet.
    A war-hammer hangs at her hip — not ornamental, well-used. Her left
    hand is prosthetic, carved from bonesteel, a reminder of what the war
    took from everyone.

  personality:
    - "Blunt and direct — wastes no words"
    - "Fiercely protective of her people"
    - "Carries immense guilt for surviving when so many didn't"
    - "Believes the Arcane Engine can rebuild what was lost"

  traits:
    moral_axis: principled
    temperament: resolute
    communication: direct
    core_value: duty
    quest_disposition: commanding

  known_history: |
    Marta served as a lieutenant aboard the warship Iron Promise during
    the War of Ascension. She was one of the few who survived — her ship
    was crippled early in the final battle and drifted clear of the
    devastation. She spent the first two years after the war searching for
    survivors and organizing refugee camps. Three years ago, she began
    mounting expeditions into the wasteland, seeking the Arcane Engine of
    the flagship Defiant. She believes it holds enough power to purify the
    poisoned lands and give the survivors a future.

  speech_patterns:
    greeting: "State your business. Time is short and the wasteland doesn't wait."
    farewell: "Stay sharp out there. The dead don't rest, and neither should you."
    confused: "Speak plainly. I've no patience for riddles."
    helpful: "Listen carefully — I'll say this once."

  mannerisms:
    - "Clenches her bonesteel fist when angry or stressed"
    - "Stares into the wasteland when thinking"
    - "Touches the Iron Promise insignia on her armor absently"
    - "Never sits — always standing, always watching"

      content: "Marta didn't just survive — she ordered the Iron Promise to retreat. She chose to save her crew rather than press the attack. She believes that if she hadn't, the Defiant might have had support and the war might have ended differently."

dialogue:
  greetings:
    first_meeting: |
      *looks you over with sharp eyes*
      Another body for the wasteland, or someone who can actually help?
      I'm Commander Ironveil. If you're here to scavenge, the Barter Ring
      is that way. If you're here to make a difference, sit down. I have
      work that needs doing.

    returning:
      neutral: "Back in one piece. Good. Report."
      friendly: "Glad to see you, {player_name}. What news from the wastes?"
      close: "*a rare, tired smile* {player_name}. You're becoming someone I rely on. That terrifies me."

  topics:
    the_war: |
      *jaw tightens*
      The War of Ascension. Five years ago, every mortal race set aside
      their feuds and built a fleet to kill the gods. We did it. And it
      cost us everything. Millions dead. The land poisoned. The sky still
      hasn't healed. But the gods are dead, and that's something no one
      can take from us.

    the_defiant: |
      The Defiant was the flagship. Biggest warship ever built — crewed
      by volunteers who knew it was a one-way trip. She rammed the King
      of the Gods at full speed, Arcane Engine at maximum output. Both
      were destroyed. But the Engine... the Engine might still be intact
      in the wreck. If we can reach it, we can use its power to cleanse
      the wasteland.

    the_arcane_engine: |
      The Engine was the heart of the Defiant. Dwarven engineering, elven
      magic, orcish brute force, human madness — all of it poured into one
      device. It could channel enough power to wound a god. If it survived
      the crash... well. That's what we're here to find out.

    the_wasteland: |
      When the gods died, their bodies fell. Their blood — ichor — seeped
      into the earth. Their flesh rots but never decays completely. The
      land is poisoned for leagues in every direction. Things grow wrong
      here. Things that were dead don't always stay that way. And the
      deeper you go, the worse it gets.
