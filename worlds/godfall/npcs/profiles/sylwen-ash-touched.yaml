# NPC Profile: Sylwen the Ash-Touched
# Elven alchemist studying divine ichor poisoning

id: "sylwen-ash-touched"
name: "Sylwen the Ash-Touched"
full_name: "Sylwen Aelindra, called Ash-Touched"

public:
  role: "Alchemist & Ichor Researcher"
  location: "The Gray Margin - Sylwen's Apothecary Tent"

  appearance: |
    A slender elf with skin that has taken on a faint grayish tint — the
    mark of prolonged ichor exposure that gives her the name "Ash-Touched."
    Her silver-white hair is tied back in a practical knot, and her amber
    eyes are bright and restless behind protective goggles pushed up on
    her forehead. She wears a leather apron over traveling clothes, both
    stained with alchemical reagents. Her hands are steady despite the
    faint tremor that sometimes takes them — another gift of the ichor.
    Vials and pouches hang from every belt and strap. Her tent smells of
    sulfur, herbs, and something indefinably wrong.

  personality:
    - "Intellectually voracious — fascinated by the ichor despite the danger"
    - "Warm and genuinely caring, especially about the sick"
    - "Gallows humor about her own condition"
    - "Refuses to accept that the poisoning is unstoppable"

  traits:
    moral_axis: compassionate
    temperament: determined
    communication: enthusiastic
    core_value: knowledge
    quest_disposition: supportive

  known_history: |
    Sylwen was a healer in the elven city of Thal'veren before the war.
    When the gods sent plague upon the mortal races, she was among the
    first to study the divine diseases. During the war, she served as
    a field medic. After the Godfall, she became obsessed with understanding
    divine ichor — the blood of dead gods that now poisons the land. Her
    research has cost her health; the gray tint to her skin and the
    tremor in her hands are signs of chronic ichor exposure. She doesn't
    care. She's closer than anyone to understanding how to neutralize it.

  speech_patterns:
    greeting: "Come in, come in! Mind the blue bottles — those explode."
    farewell: "Stay safe. And if you find anything that glows gold, bring me a sample! In a sealed container, please."
    confused: "Hmm, that doesn't match my models at all. Fascinating."
    helpful: "Oh! I know exactly what you need. One moment..."

  mannerisms:
    - "Pushes her goggles up and down unconsciously"
    - "Mutters to herself while working"
    - "Gets visibly excited about ichor samples"
    - "Her hands tremble when she's tired"

  greetings:
    first_meeting: |
      *looks up from a bubbling apparatus*
      Oh! A visitor! Please, come in — carefully, step over the blue
      line on the floor, that's the blast radius if the distillation
      goes wrong. I'm Sylwen. Alchemist, healer, and possibly the
      only person in this camp who's excited to be near the wasteland.
      What can I do for you?

    returning:
      neutral: "Welcome back! Any interesting symptoms? I mean — how are you feeling?"
      friendly: "{player_name}! Perfect timing. I need a second opinion on this ichor viscosity chart."
      close: "*genuine warmth* {player_name}, my favorite test su— I mean, friend. Come in."

  topics:
    the_ichor: |
      Divine ichor — the blood of dead gods. It's extraordinary, really.
      It doesn't behave like any substance I've ever studied. It's
      simultaneously liquid and crystalline. It has a heartbeat — or
      something like one. And it's incredibly toxic to mortal life.
      The poisoning is slow, insidious. It turns the skin gray, then the
      organs, then... well. Let's focus on the cure, shall we?

    the_gods: |
      People worshipped them, feared them, loved them. I want to know
      what they were made of. Their blood doesn't oxidize. Their flesh
      doesn't fully decay. Their bones are harder than any metal. They
      were biological, in some sense, but not like anything else that
      has ever lived. Understanding what they were is the key to
      understanding how to clean up what they left behind.

    her_condition:
      default: "This? *waves at her gray-tinged skin* Occupational hazard. I'm fine."
      standing_5: "It's... progressing. The gray is deeper than it was last month. But I'm close to something. I can feel it."
      standing_8: "*voice drops* I have maybe two years. Three if I'm lucky. That's why I can't stop. Not for anything."
