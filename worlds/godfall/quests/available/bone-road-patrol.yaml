summary: |
  The route from the Gray Margin to the Bonefield — called the Bone Road
  by scavengers — has seen increased Bone Shambler activity. Commander
  Ironveil needs someone to patrol the road, clear out any undead, and
  ensure safe passage for supply runners and scouts. It's grim, repetitive
  work, but the camp depends on it.
