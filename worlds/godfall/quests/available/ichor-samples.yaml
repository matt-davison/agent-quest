summary: |
  Sylwen needs fresh ichor samples from different sources to continue
  her research into neutralizing divine corruption. She needs a sample
  from the Ichor Marsh (pooled ichor), a sample from the Bonefield
  (ichor-saturated bone), and if possible, a sample from a living
  Ichor Wraith. The last one is particularly dangerous, but Sylwen
  insists the data from a "living" ichor manifestation is invaluable.
  She'll provide sealed collection vials and basic protective equipment.
