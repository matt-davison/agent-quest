summary: |
  Five years ago, the flagship Defiant rammed the King of the Gods and
  ended the War of Ascension. Both were destroyed. But the Arcane Engine
  that powered the Defiant — the single most powerful device ever built
  by mortal hands — may have survived the crash. Commander Ironveil has
  organized an expedition to find it. If the Engine still works, it could
  purify the poisoned wasteland and give the survivors a future. The
  journey will take you through the Bonefield, past rotting god-corpses,
  through poisoned marshes, and into the wreck itself. What you find
  there may not be what anyone expected.
