description: |
  Five years ago, the mortal races united against the gods who had
  tormented them with famine, plague, and cruelty for sport. Elves,
  orcs, dwarves, humans, and every kindred folk built a fleet of
  arcane warships and waged war on the heavens. In the final battle,
  the flagship engaged the King of the Gods in single combat above
  the world. Both were destroyed. Every god fell. Every fighter
  perished. Now the gray wasteland where they died stretches for
  hundreds of leagues, the land poisoned by divine ichor and rotting
  celestial flesh. The survivors eke out existence on the margins,
  and the brave or desperate venture inward seeking relics of the
  war — chief among them, the Arcane Engine that powered the flagship.
