description: |
  Sub-Committee 7 has scheduled a Final Review of the Terrarium project.
  In 42 days, the oversight board will evaluate whether Project 42-B has
  demonstrated "measurable value." If it hasn't, the project will be
  "decommissioned" — a bureaucratic euphemism for sterilizing the
  ecosystem and repurposing the geological formation. Everyone in the
  Terrarium will die. Not metaphorically. Actually die.

  The inhabitants don't fully understand this yet. The monoliths are
  broadcasting warnings in corporate jargon that nobody can parse. But
  the signs are there: Maintenance Orbs behaving erratically, increased
  seismic activity, The Bulb flickering during diagnostics, and Curator
  Station Sigma showing activity for the first time in millennia.

  The clock is ticking. The question is not whether the Terrarium can be
  saved. The question is whether anyone can figure out what "demonstrating
  measurable value" means to a bureaucratic alien oversight committee
  before time runs out.

    description: |
      The monoliths are getting louder. Maintenance Orbs are behaving
      strangely. Grunk's teeth ache. Something is coming, but nobody
      knows what. Players explore the Terrarium, meet the factions, and
      begin to piece together the truth from Curator Memos and monolith
      broadcasts.

      The truth is revealed: the Terrarium is an alien experiment, and
      it's about to be shut down. Players must unite the factions — the
      Tribe, the Scaled Court, the Maintenance Orbs, even the Titan Cult
      — to face the coming review. But first, they need to reach Curator
      Station Sigma and access the project archives.

      The countdown reaches zero. Sub-Committee 7 begins its assessment.
      Players must find a way to demonstrate the Terrarium's value — or
      find an alternative to compliance. Multiple endings depending on
      player choices, faction alliances, and discoveries.

# === ENDINGS ===
endings:
  - id: "compliance"
    name: "The Report Card"
    description: |
      Submit the evidence of the Terrarium's achievements to Sub-Committee 7
      in their own language — bureaucratic metrics, data tables, and value
      propositions. The review board is satisfied. The Terrarium gets another
      funding cycle. Life continues. The paperwork is eternal.
    requirements:
      - "Collected 20+ Curator Memos"
      - "Allied with Skitter (standing >= 6)"
      - "Accessed full Station Sigma archives"

  - id: "defiance"
    name: "The Lock-Out"
    description: |
      Use Curator tech to lock Sub-Committee 7 out of the Terrarium's
      systems. Sever the monolith network's connection to the oversight
      board. The Terrarium becomes independent — and alone. No more
      maintenance updates, no more Bulb support, no more safety net. But
      also no more reviews. Freedom, at a cost.
    requirements:
      - "Tinker class OR allied with Skitter (standing >= 8)"
      - "Reached The Shell"
      - "Obtained the Contingency Kit from Rattlejaw"

  - id: "negotiation"
    name: "The New Terms"
    description: |
      Establish direct communication with Sub-Committee 7 and negotiate
      new terms. The Terrarium is reclassified from "experiment" to
      "autonomous protectorate." The inhabitants gain a voice. The
      Curators keep their data. Nobody is fully happy. This is how you
      know the negotiation worked.
    requirements:
      - "Allied with Fang (standing >= 6)"
      - "All factions at neutral or better"
      - "Translated the Dissenting Opinion for Sub-Committee 7"

  - id: "awakening"
    name: "The Sleeper Wakes"
    description: |
      Wake Specimen T-001 — Gorath — from its dormancy. The dormant kaiju
      beneath The Hollow is the single most impressive specimen in the
      Terrarium. Its awakening is terrifying, destructive, and undeniable
      proof that Project 42-B produced something Sub-Committee 7 cannot
      ignore. Whether this saves the Terrarium or dooms it depends on
      whether anyone can calm Gorath down afterward.
    requirements:
      - "Discovered The Heart Chamber secret"
      - "Level >= 9"
      - "Beastwhisperer class OR allied with the Titan Cult"
