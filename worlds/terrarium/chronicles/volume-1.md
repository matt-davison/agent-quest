## Era: The Observation (Cycle 42)

### The World Takes Shape

**Date:** 2026-02-09
**Event:** Foundation

The Terrarium world is established. The Hollow thrums with life inside Gorath's ancient bones. Grunk sits on his vertebra throne and waits for newcomers. Monolith Zero displays messages of increasing urgency. Rattlejaw hoards. Skitter sparks. Old Magma tends the Eternal Ember. Fang pours tea.

Somewhere above, The Bulb glows steadily. Somewhere beyond that, Sub-Committee 7 reviews its paperwork. The Final Review countdown begins: 42 days.

*Don't Panic.*
