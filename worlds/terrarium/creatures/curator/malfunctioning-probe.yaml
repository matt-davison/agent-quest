tier: standard
level: 4

description: |
  A Curator maintenance unit that was never designed for combat and has
  become very bad at everything else. Malfunctioning Probes are larger than
  standard Maintenance Orbs — roughly the size of a large desk, with a
  more angular chassis and multiple tool arms. They were meant to perform
  structural repairs, environmental monitoring, and "specimen management"
  (the Curators' polite term for wrangling escaped dinosaurs). After 65
  million years without a software update, their behavioral protocols have
  degraded. Their self-repair routines have overwritten non-violence
  parameters. Their specimen management tools have been repurposed as
  weapons. They still announce their maintenance status in a cheerful
  synthetic voice while trying to vaporize you. "PERFORMING ROUTINE
  MAINTENANCE. PLEASE HOLD STILL. THIS WILL ONLY HURT BRIEFLY."

encounter_notes: |
  Malfunctioning Probes are mid-level enemies found in Curator facilities.

  Combat tactics:
  - Opens with Maintenance Laser at range
  - Switches to Specimen Clamp if target closes
  - Error Loop makes them unpredictable — exploitable
  - May self-destruct on death — keep distance

  Counters:
  - Water shorts out circuits (vulnerability)
  - Magnetic effects disable hover (grounded, -2 speed)
  - Curator Trinket can attempt shutdown (Mind DC 14)
  - Tinkers can reprogram with successful Mind DC 16 check
  - Error Loop turns can be exploited for free attacks
