description: |
  Not all raptors in the Terrarium are mindless predators. The Elder Raptors
  are senior members of the Scaled Court — intelligent, experienced, and
  sophisticated enough to wear accessories. They stand about six feet tall,
  with iridescent green-blue scales maintained to a mirror polish, and eyes
  that assess you the way a chess grandmaster assesses a board. They carry
  themselves with lethal grace and perfect posture. Elder Raptors may
  negotiate before combat, may offer terms during combat, and may critique
  your technique after combat. They are terrifyingly competent in a fight
  but vastly prefer to resolve situations through what they call
  "civilized discourse" — though their definition of civilized includes
  the phrase "or I will eat you."

encounter_notes: |
  Elder Raptors are unique enemies that can become allies mid-combat.

  Combat tactics:
  - Opens with Pounce to pin the most dangerous target
  - Uses Precision Claw for sustained damage
  - Tactical Assessment makes long fights increasingly dangerous
  - May offer Parley — accepting can end combat peacefully

  Counters:
  - Cold damage slows them significantly
  - Accepting Parley avoids combat entirely
  - Beastwhisperers have advantage on Parley checks
  - Area denial prevents Pounce

  Special: Defeating an Elder Raptor reduces Scaled Court standing by 1.
  Negotiating successfully increases standing by 1.
