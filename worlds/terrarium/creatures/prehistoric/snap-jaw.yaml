tier: minion
level: 1

description: |
  A small, fast predator about the size of a large dog — lean, feathered in
  muted browns and greens, with an oversized jaw that snaps shut with enough
  force to crack bone. Snap-jaws hunt in packs, communicating through rapid
  chirps and coordinated flanking maneuvers that suggest an intelligence just
  barely below the threshold of "we should probably negotiate." They're the
  most common predator in the central Terrarium, filling the ecological niche
  of "the thing that chases you when you leave the settlement." The Scaled
  Court considers them distant, embarrassing cousins. The Snap-jaws do not
  appear to reciprocate this awareness.

encounter_notes: |
  Snap-jaws are the tutorial enemy of Terrarium. They teach new players
  about pack mechanics and the value of area attacks or fire.

  Combat tactics:
  - Attack in packs, exploiting Pack Tactics for bonus damage
  - Flank isolated targets
  - Use tall grass for ambush attacks
  - Scatter or frenzy when losses mount

  Counters:
  - Fire damage scares them
  - Area attacks break up packs
  - Holding ground with shield prevents flanking
  - Loud noises can trigger early scatter
