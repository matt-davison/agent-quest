tier: standard
level: 3

description: |
  A heavily armored herbivorous dinosaur the size of a rhinoceros, covered
  in bony plates and studded with sharp spines along its back and tail. The
  Thornback is not aggressive by nature — it grazes peacefully on the fungal
  meadows and crystal moss of the Terrarium. But its territorial instinct is
  absolute. Cross into a Thornback's claimed grazing ground and it will
  lower its head, display its spine ridge, and charge with the subtlety of
  a boulder with opinions. The charge is devastating. The good news is that
  Thornbacks are not fast. The bad news is that they don't need to be.

encounter_notes: |
  Thornbacks teach players about armored enemies and positioning.

  Combat tactics:
  - Opens with Charge if at range
  - Uses Gore in melee, pushes targets into hazards if possible
  - Spine Shield punishes melee attackers
  - Will flee when badly wounded

  Counters:
  - Ranged attacks avoid Spine Shield
  - Fire damage bypasses armor resistance
  - Flanking negates Spine Shield on the flanked side
  - Can be calmed by Beastwhisperers (Spirit DC 14)
