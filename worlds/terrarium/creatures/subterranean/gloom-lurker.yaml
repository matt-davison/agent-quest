tier: standard
level: 4

description: |
  A creature evolved for the dark spaces between the Terrarium's lit zones.
  The Gloom Lurker is roughly humanoid in shape — long limbs, a hunched
  posture, skin the color and texture of wet cave rock. It clings to
  ceilings and walls with adhesive pads on its hands and feet, remaining
  perfectly still until prey passes below. Its eyes are huge, pale, and
  adapted to absolute darkness. Its mouth is wider than it should be.
  Gloom Lurkers are ambush predators — patient, silent, and devastating
  in the first strike. After the initial attack, they're less formidable
  but still dangerous. They never attack in the light if they can help it.
  The Curators classified them as "opportunistic cavity dwellers" in a
  memo that also suggested "enhanced lighting as a population control
  measure." The budget for enhanced lighting was never approved.
