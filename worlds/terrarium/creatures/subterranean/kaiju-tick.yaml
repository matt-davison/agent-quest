tier: elite
level: 7

description: |
  A parasite the size of a bus. Let that sink in. The Kaiju Tick is a
  bloated, armored arthropod that feeds on the blood of dormant kaiju —
  burrowing into their calcified hide and drinking from veins that pulse
  with something that isn't quite blood but is definitely terrifying. They
  nest in the upper slopes of Mount Tremor and in deep caverns where kaiju
  tissue is exposed. When a Kaiju Tick encounters a warm-blooded creature,
  it registers it as "kaiju blood, but smaller and more convenient." Eight
  armored legs, a drilling proboscis, and a carapace that shrugs off most
  conventional weapons. The Curators' original memo on Kaiju Ticks
  contained exactly one word: "Unfortunate."

encounter_notes: |
  Kaiju Ticks are dangerous grapple-focused enemies.

  Combat tactics:
  - Opens with Drill Bite to grapple
  - Uses Blood Drain every round while grappling
  - Becomes harder to kill after Engorge triggers
  - Will release grapple and flee from sustained fire

  Counters:
  - Fire forces it to release grapple
  - Acid bypasses Armored Carapace
  - Called shots to leg joints bypass physical resistance
  - Tinker traps can immobilize before it grapples
  - Two or more allies can make Strength checks to pull it off
