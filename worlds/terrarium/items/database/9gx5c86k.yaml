description: |
  A disc of brushed alien metal roughly four feet in diameter, discovered by
  Ser Burgerboxxx in a Curator debris field near the Sulphur Pools. It
  responds to weight shifts with smooth, silent hovering — three feet off the
  ground, no higher, no lower, regardless of terrain. The Throne has no
  visible controls, no seams, and no apparent power source. It hums at a
  frequency that makes your teeth itch. Skitter examined it once, declared it
  "probably a maintenance cart for transporting equipment between sectors,"
  and refused to elaborate. Ser Burgerboxxx has repurposed it as his primary
  mode of transportation, his pulpit, his dining chair, and — when the
  sermons run long — his bed. The disc has developed a slight list to the
  left from bearing his considerable weight for six moons. It does not seem
  to mind. The hum gets louder when he's angry, which everyone has learned
  to treat as an early warning system.
