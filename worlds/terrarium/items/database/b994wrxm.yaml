description: |
  Voluminous robes stitched from layered dinosaur hide, dyed deep crimson
  with mineral pigments from the Sulphur Pools and deliberately singed at
  every hem and edge. The burn marks are not accidental — Ser Burgerboxxx
  holds each new garment over fire as a "blessing" before wearing it. The
  result looks like something a very large monk would wear to a bonfire
  and is, against all probability, genuinely fire-resistant. The hides
  were treated with a mineral solution that Old Magma provided, either
  out of professional respect for a fellow fire-handler or because she
  wanted to see if he'd actually douse himself in sulphur water. He did.
  It worked. The robes billow dramatically when the Hovering Throne picks
  up speed, which Ser Burgerboxxx considers essential to his ministry.
