description: |
  A hollowed kaiju vertebra the size of a human head, packed with ember-stone
  chips that glow perpetually with heat stolen from the Eternal Ember. It
  hangs from a chain of interlocking bone links and swings with devastating
  momentum when Ser Burgerboxxx works himself into a righteous fury, which is
  most of the time. When used as a spell focus, the ember-stones flare bright
  orange and the Sacred Censer trails smoke like a comet. When used as a
  weapon, it hits like a flaming wrecking ball wielded by a very fat man on
  a floating disc, which is exactly what it is. The bone has been carved with
  symbols that Ser Burgerboxxx claims are "the holy script of the Divine
  Flame." Skitter says they're Curator maintenance codes for a waste
  recycling system. Both interpretations remain theologically unresolved.
