description: |
  A gnarled staff carved from a petrified tree root, wrapped in strips of
  shed kaiju skin that still faintly pulse with bioluminescent pheromones.
  Caroline made it herself, left-handed, over the course of a long wet
  season. The skin strips are from Gentle — a juvenile stegosaur who lets
  Caroline scratch behind its plates and sheds regularly. When the staff
  is planted in the ground, nearby megafauna grow calm and curious. When
  swung at something's skull, it is slightly less calming. The pheromone
  coating means it always smells like a large herbivore in a good mood,
  which is either reassuring or confusing depending on your species.
