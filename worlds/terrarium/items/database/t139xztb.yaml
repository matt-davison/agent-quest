  A small dinosaur-hide pouch containing dried strips of Dreamer's Cap —
  a bioluminescent fungus that grows in the warm, damp crevices of Gorath's
  ribcage. When smoked in a rolled dino-hide paper, it produces a fragrant
  blue-green haze and a gentle euphoria that Caroline swears enhances her
  empathic connection with megafauna. She might be right — Dreamer's Cap
  contains trace compounds that mimic the Terrarium's naturally occurring
  bioluminescent pheromones. Or she might just like being high. Old Magma
  sells the good stuff. Rattlejaw sells the mediocre stuff and claims it's
  the good stuff. Caroline can tell the difference. The beasts can too.
