description: |
  A femur bone from something that was very large and is now very dead.
  Shaped by striking it against a rock until one end was thicker than the
  other. This is the entirety of the manufacturing process. It works
  surprisingly well. Grunk named his "Thoughtful." You do not have to
  name yours. But you should.
