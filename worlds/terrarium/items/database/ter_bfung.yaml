description: |
  A chunk of glowing fungus harvested from the cavern walls. When squeezed
  or thrown, it emits a steady blue-green glow for several hours. Used as
  portable light sources, trail markers, and improvised Gloom Lurker
  deterrents. Every settlement has them. They grow everywhere. The
  Terrarium's answer to the flashlight, except organic, slightly slimy,
  and it makes your hands glow for a day after handling. The Curators
  engineered the fungi as part of the ecosystem's lighting supplement.
  It's one of the few things they got exactly right.
