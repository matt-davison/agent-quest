description: |
  A sharpened bone shaft with a chipped obsidian tip, bound with sinew.
  Can be used in melee or thrown with reasonable accuracy. The obsidian
  comes from Mount Tremor's lower slopes, where volcanic glass forms
  naturally. The Tribe has been making these for generations. The design
  hasn't changed because the design doesn't need to change. Pointy end
  goes in the other thing. Done.
