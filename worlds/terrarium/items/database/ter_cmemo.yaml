  A thin crystalline wafer that, when activated (squeeze and shake),
  projects a short holographic text in Curator script with a rough
  translation below. These are internal project reports, meeting minutes,
  and inter-departmental communications from Project 42-B's staff. They
  range from the mundane ("Requisition Form 7742-C: Request for Additional
  Bioluminescent Substrate") to the alarming ("Re: Unscheduled Mutation
  Event — WHO APPROVED SPECIMEN T-001?") to the deeply bureaucratic
  ("Synergize cross-functional deliverables by EOQ or face deprecation
  of non-essential assets"). The inhabitants interpret them as prophecy.
  They're performance reviews. Same thing, really.
