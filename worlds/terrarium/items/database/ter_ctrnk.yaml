  A small, smooth piece of alien technology — could be a component, a tool,
  or a particularly sophisticated doorstop. Curator Trinkets come in many
  shapes: crystalline wafers, metallic cylinders, translucent orbs that
  hum when touched. Nobody fully understands what any of them do. Tinkers
  can coax limited functionality from them — basic interfaces with Curator
  systems, minor energy output, and the occasional unscheduled holographic
  display. They're found in Curator debris fields, Maintenance Orb nests,
  and occasionally embedded in monoliths. Rattlejaw hoards them. Skitter
  disassembles them. The Scaled Court studies them. The Titan Cult
  worships them. Everyone else sells them.
