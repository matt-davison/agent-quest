description: |
  Several layers of cured dinosaur hide, stitched together with sinew
  and draped over the shoulders and torso. It smells like leather and
  something older. The hide comes from herbivorous dinosaurs — nobody's
  brave enough to skin a predator. Provides decent protection against
  claws and teeth while allowing free movement. Fashion-forward members
  of the Tribe dye theirs with bioluminescent fungus. The effect is
  either "ethereal warrior" or "walking nightlight" depending on the
  craftsmanship.
