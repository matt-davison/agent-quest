description: |
  A small stone vial containing a glowing amber liquid brewed by Old Magma
  from fungal extracts and minerals heated over the Eternal Ember. It tastes
  like warm honey mixed with something that is definitely not honey and
  probably shouldn't be asked about. Restores health and makes you feel
  unreasonably optimistic for about ten minutes. Old Magma says the Ember's
  warmth goes into every potion. Given that the Ember has been burning since
  before recorded history, that's either comforting or terrifying.
