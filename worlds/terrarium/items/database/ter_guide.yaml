  A stone tablet roughly the size of a large book, with a smooth face that
  lights up when touched, displaying text in the local language. The Guide
  is a self-updating information device — one of several distributed
  throughout the Terrarium by a source that nobody can identify. Its
  entries are comprehensive, suspiciously well-informed, and written in a
  tone that suggests the author is both very knowledgeable and at least
  mildly intoxicated. The Guide covers geography, creatures, factions,
  history, and survival tips, all filtered through a perspective that is
  simultaneously helpful and deeply unhelpful. The front page reads, in
  large, friendly letters: "DON'T PANIC."

  Sample entry: "SNAP-JAWS: Small pack predators. Individually manageable.
  In groups, inadvisable. In large groups, reconsider your life choices.
  The Scaled Court claims they are 'distant cousins.' This is like a
  human claiming kinship with a particularly angry squirrel. Technically
  accurate. Practically meaningless."

  The Guide updates itself. Nobody knows how. Chroniclers start with one.
  Everyone else has to earn it.
