description: |
  A single shed kaiju tooth, about the size of a human finger. Kaiju shed
  teeth constantly — the larger specimens lose hundreds per cycle, and the
  teeth rain down from the upper caverns during Bonefall (month 8). They're
  hard as stone, faintly warm, and each one is unique in the same way every
  pebble on a beach is unique — technically true, practically irrelevant.
  The Terrarium's universal currency. One tooth buys you a drink, a meal,
  or a small child's respect. The Curators would be fascinated by this
  emergent economic system. They'd probably write a memo about it.
