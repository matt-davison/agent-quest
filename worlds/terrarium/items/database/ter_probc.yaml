description: |
  A singed circuit board from the malfunctioning Curator probe that was
  clogging the thermal vents at the Sulphur Pools. Despite the damage it
  sustained from the Ember Touch and Pheromone Staff strikes, it still hums
  faintly with alien power. The green coolant has dried to a crust on its
  surface. It might be salvageable by someone who understands Curator
  technology, or it might just be an interesting trophy of your victory.
