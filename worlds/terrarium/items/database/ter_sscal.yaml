  A single scale shed by a large dinosaur, about the size of your palm
  and surprisingly tough. Shed scales are collected and used as
  reinforcement patches for armor, shields, and the occasional decorative
  piece. The Scaled Court considers the collection of shed scales
  acceptable but finds the concept "mildly undignified, like collecting
  someone's toenail clippings." They are not wrong, but the scales work.
