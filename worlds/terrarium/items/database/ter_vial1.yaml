description: |
  A small stone vial with a cork stopper, handed to you by Old Magma herself
  as a token of her trust. Its surface is warm to the touch, and inside you can
  see something glimmering — a memory of the Eternal Ember, perhaps, or the
  warmth of the first fire. Old Magma smiled when she gave it to you. "Keep it
  safe," she said. "It holds something precious." Currently empty, waiting for
  you to find what belongs inside.
