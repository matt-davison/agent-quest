# === ADDING NEW LOCATIONS ===
# To add a new location:
# 1. Create directory: locations/<location-id>/
# 2. Create locations/<location-id>/location.yaml with coordinates, type, connections
# 3. Create locations/<location-id>/README.md with narrative description
# 4. Add connections to neighboring locations' location.yaml files
# 5. Optionally create areas/<area-id>.yaml for sub-locations
# 6. WORLD EXPANSION: Add frontier stubs as unexplored_connections above.
