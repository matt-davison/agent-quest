# Bonewood Forest

> _The trees remember. The raptors don't forget._

## Description

West of The Hollow, the cavern floor rises into rocky ridges covered by a forest that turned to stone fifty million years ago and never got the memo that it was dead. The Bonewood is a petrified prehistoric forest — trees hundreds of feet tall, fossilized mid-growth, their stone trunks wrapped in living bioluminescent moss that makes the whole forest glow in shifting greens and purples. The canopy is solid rock laced with crystal formations that catch and scatter The Bulb's light into prismatic patterns on the forest floor. It's beautiful. It's also full of raptors.

The Scaled Court claims the Bonewood as ancestral territory, though they're diplomatic enough to tolerate travelers who "observe appropriate protocols" — meaning don't touch the amber deposits, don't startle the hatchlings, and absolutely do not refer to them as "lizards." Wild raptors and less civilized predators also call the forest home, hunting in the perpetual twilight between the stone trunks. Gloom Lurkers nest in the canopy, dropping on anything warm that passes below.

The forest floor is carpeted with bioluminescent moss that reacts to pressure — every footstep leaves a glowing print that fades over minutes. Stealth is difficult. The Scaled Court considers this a feature, not a bug.

## Points of Interest

### The Amber Galleries
Sections of petrified trunk where ancient sap trapped and preserved specimens from millions of years ago — insects, small creatures, and occasionally something that looks disturbingly technological.

### The Raptor Courts
Clearings maintained by the Scaled Court as meeting places and diplomatic venues. Surprisingly civilized — stone benches, carved markers, and what appears to be a judicial system.

### The Canopy Bridges
Ancient root systems connecting the upper trunks, now fossilized into natural bridges. Used by the Scaled Court as elevated highways. Accessible to other species with sufficient climbing skill.

## Secrets

<details>
<summary>The Grove of Voices</summary>

During The Quiet (month 9), enter the deepest part of the Bonewood with Spirit 6 or higher. The petrified trees resonate at a frequency that carries sound from across the Terrarium — and across time. You can hear fragments of Curator transmissions from millions of years ago, layered over each other like geological strata. Among them: the original activation sequence for The Bulb, and a warning about "unscheduled mutation events in Sector 7" — the first kaiju.
