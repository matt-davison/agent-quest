# Curator Station Sigma

> _Please badge in at reception. Reception has been dead for 60 million years._

## Description

Hidden behind a holographic cliff face on the eastern edge of the Terrarium lies the entrance to Curator Station Sigma — one of the original research facilities built during the Terrarium's construction phase. The holographic disguise has degraded over the millennia, flickering occasionally to reveal a smooth metallic door frame that looks wildly out of place in the rock. Inside, the facility is a jarring contrast to the organic world outside: clean geometric corridors, fluorescent lighting (half of it dead, the rest flickering), seamless metal floors, and the persistent hum of machinery that hasn't been serviced in geological time.

Station Sigma was a research and monitoring outpost — the Curators' eyes inside their own experiment. When they withdrew to focus on other projects (the memo cites "budget reallocation to Project 43-A: Bipedal Optimization"), they left the station on automated maintenance. The Maintenance Orbs kept it running. For 65 million years. Some of them are still running. Some of them have developed opinions. Some of them have developed problems.

Malfunctioning Probes — larger, more aggressive maintenance units whose self-repair protocols have overwritten their non-violence parameters — patrol the deeper sections. Security systems activate at random. Data terminals still function but require Curator interface protocols (or a very creative Tinker). The facility is vast, multi-leveled, and full of answers to questions the inhabitants of the Terrarium have been asking for millennia.

## Points of Interest

### The Atrium
The entry hall. A massive space with a domed ceiling that once displayed a real-time holographic map of the Terrarium. Now it displays fragments — glitching patches of geography interspersed with static. A reception desk sits at the center, staffed by a Maintenance Orb that has been running its greeting protocol on loop for 60 million years.

### The Laboratory Wing
Research facilities where the Curators studied their "specimens." Tanks that once held biological samples. Genetic sequencers. A whiteboard with equations in an alien script. Someone has drawn a smiley face on it in marker that hasn't dried in millions of years.

### The Server Core
The facility's central data repository. Heavily guarded by Malfunctioning Probes. Contains the complete Project 42-B archive — every report, every memo, every Sub-Committee 7 meeting minutes. The answer to every question about the Terrarium is here. So are the answers nobody wants to hear.

## Secrets

<details>
<summary>The Archive</summary>

Clear all three security zones and reach the Server Core. Interface with the central terminal (Curator Trinket, Chronicler class, or Tinker class at Level 6+). The complete Project 42-B archive reveals everything: the Terrarium was one of thousands of experiments across the galaxy. Most have been decommissioned. "Decommissioned" means sterilized. The Final Review isn't an evaluation — it's a formality before termination. Sub-Committee 7 has already filed the paperwork. But the archive also contains something else: a dissenting opinion from a Curator scientist, arguing that Project 42-B has exceeded all viability parameters. The project was supposed to fail. It didn't. And that makes some very powerful beings very uncomfortable.
