# Mount Tremor

> _The mountain breathes. Don't wake it up._

## Description

The largest geological feature in the central Terrarium isn't geological at all. Mount Tremor is a kaiju — alive, dormant, and so massive that over millions of years, rock, soil, and vegetation have accumulated on its body until it became indistinguishable from a mountain. Geothermal vents are its breath. Seismic tremors are its heartbeat. The volcano at its peak is a byproduct of its metabolic processes. The Curators classified it as "Specimen T-001: Unscheduled Mutation, Category: Colossal" in a memo that also noted, with evident frustration, "this was not in the project brief."

The mountain rises steeply from the eastern plains, its lower slopes covered in hardy vegetation and loose volcanic rock. Higher up, the air thickens with sulphurous gas, the ground radiates heat, and the tremors become strong enough to knock you off your feet. Kaiju Ticks — parasites the size of buses that feed on the dormant creature's blood — infest the upper slopes. The Titan Cult maintains shrines at various elevations, their pilgrims ascending in ecstatic worship of what they correctly believe is a living god. They're correct. Nobody finds this comforting.

The caldera at the peak isn't a volcanic crater — it's a wound. Something pierced Specimen T-001 millions of years ago, and the depression that formed has filled with superheated mineral water. Looking down into it, on a clear day, you can see something massive shift beneath the surface.

## Points of Interest

### The Pilgrim's Path
A winding trail maintained by the Titan Cult, marked with bone totems and offerings. Relatively safe compared to unmarked routes, but Cult pilgrims may be hostile to those who "disrespect the Sleeping One."

### The Tick Caves
Caves bored into the mountainside by Kaiju Ticks — actually tunnels through the dormant kaiju's calcified hide. Inside, the walls pulse. The temperature is uncomfortable. The Ticks are worse.

### The Caldera
The peak of Mount Tremor. A steaming lake of superheated mineral water fills the depression. Monolith fragments jut from the water — a Curator monitoring station, now half-submerged. The Titan Cult holds their most sacred ceremonies here.

## Secrets

<details>
<summary>The Sleeper</summary>

Reach the caldera at level 7+ with a Curator Trinket. Interface with the submerged monolith fragments. The monitoring station was placed here to track Specimen T-001's vital signs — and the readings show it's not just dormant. It's dreaming. The Curator data includes a waking probability curve that spikes sharply at a date corresponding to the Final Review. Sub-Committee 7 knows. The question is whether "decommissioning" the Terrarium would kill it, wake it, or make it angry.
