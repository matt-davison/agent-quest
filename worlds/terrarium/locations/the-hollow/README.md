# The Hollow

> _Home is where the bones are._

## Description

The Hollow is built inside the ribcage of Gorath — a kaiju that died so long ago that its bones have calcified into stone harder than granite. Nobody remembers what killed Gorath, but nobody's complaining. The ribcage arches two hundred feet overhead, each rib as wide as a house, crusted with bioluminescent fungi that bathe everything in shifting blue-green light. The spine runs above like a cathedral ceiling. Hanging gardens of luminous moss trail from vertebrae. It smells like warm stone, cooking meat, and the faint ozone tang of Curator technology that nobody can identify but everyone's used to.

The Tribe of the Tall Stone settled here three generations ago, drawn by the natural shelter, the warmth rising from marrow vents in the ancient bones, and the monolith embedded in Gorath's skull — the first monolith anyone ever found. They built homes in the spaces between ribs, strung bridges between vertebrae, and hollowed chambers from the larger bones. It's cramped, it's strange, and the whole settlement creaks when the wind shifts. It's home.

From the outside, Gorath's skeleton dominates the cavern floor — a mountain of pale bone against the perpetual glow of The Bulb far above. Travelers see it from miles away and either feel relief or dread, depending on what's chasing them.

## Points of Interest

### The Sternum

The central plaza, built on and around Gorath's massive sternum bone. Flattened and worn smooth by generations of feet, it serves as the settlement's gathering place, court, and stage. Grunk holds council here, sitting on a throne carved from a fused vertebra. Fang maintains a diplomatic pavilion at the plaza's edge — a surprisingly elegant tent made from dyed dinosaur hide, furnished with cushions and a tea service. The Sternum is where decisions are made, visitors are welcomed, and arguments are settled (usually by Grunk suggesting that the parties "hit each other less").

**Interactions:**

- Speak with Grunk the Relatively Wise for quests and guidance
- Meet Fang for diplomatic inquiries and world news
- Attend tribal councils and announcements
- Access the settlement's message board (Monolith Zero broadcasts)

### The Gullet

The marketplace, built in what was once Gorath's throat. The esophagus walls — now petrified into smooth, ribbed stone — create a natural tunnel lined with vendor stalls. Rattlejaw, an elderly Maintenance Orb who stopped maintaining things and started hoarding them 40 million years ago, runs the general store from a nest of accumulated junk. Other vendors sell from blankets and bone-shelf displays. The acoustics are terrible — every haggle echoes.

**Interactions:**

- Buy and sell equipment at Rattlejaw's shop
- Trade with visiting merchants from the Scaled Court
- Commission custom items from Tinker artisans
- Check supply board for material requests

### The Marrow Tap

The tavern and inn, carved from one of Gorath's femurs. The bone was hollowed millennia ago and the interior walls still faintly glow with residual bioluminescence from whatever process consumed the marrow. Old Magma tends the Eternal Ember here — a fire that hasn't gone out in living memory, fed by gases seeping through cracks in Gorath's skeleton. The drinks are fermented fungus, the food is roasted lizard, and Old Magma's stories are worth both.

**Interactions:**

- Rest to restore HP (3 teeth/night)
- Listen to Old Magma for lore and wisdom
- Sample fungal brews (various effects)
- Meet other travelers and hear rumors

### Monolith Zero

The first monolith ever discovered, embedded in Gorath's skull like a strange geometric tumor. It's a perfect black rectangle, three meters tall, that hums faintly and is always slightly warm to the touch. The Tribe worships it. It's actually a firmware update terminal that hasn't received a firmware update in 65 million years, but still dutifully displays Curator status messages that the inhabitants interpret as prophecy. Recently, it's been displaying messages more frequently. The messages are getting more urgent.

**Interactions:**

- Read current monolith displays (quest hooks and lore)
- Consult the monolith for guidance (Chronicler bonus)
- Pray at the monolith (Tribe of the Tall Stone standing bonus)
- Attempt to interface directly (requires Curator Trinket)

### The Tinkerer's Nook

A workshop wedged into the joints where ribs meet spine, accessible by a bone-rung ladder. Skitter — a Maintenance Orb who "went native" and now identifies more with the tribe than with the Curators — maintains a chaotic workspace full of half-understood Curator technology, improvised tools, and things that spark when you touch them. The Nook is where weapons get repaired, Curator trinkets get examined, and occasionally something explodes.

**Interactions:**

- Train abilities (costs teeth)
- Repair damaged equipment
- Identify Curator artifacts
- Learn tinkering techniques from Skitter

## Secrets

<details>
<summary>Monolith Zero Backdoor</summary>

During Deepnight, touch Monolith Zero with a Curator Trinket (or as a Chronicler, bare-handed). The display shifts from Tribe-facing prophecy to raw Curator diagnostic output. Among the status reports: a countdown labeled "PROJECT 42-B: FINAL DELIVERABLE ASSESSMENT — T-42 CYCLES." The monolith knows the review is coming. It's been trying to warn everyone, in the only language it has.

<details>
<summary>The Heart Chamber</summary>

Reach standing 5 with Grunk and ask about "the beating." Deep beneath The Hollow, in a chamber that was Gorath's heart, something still pulses. Not a heartbeat — a signal. Regular, rhythmic, broadcast on a frequency that only Curator technology can detect. Gorath isn't dead. Gorath is dormant. And whatever the Curators fed it 65 million years ago is still running.
