  Embedded in the back of Gorath's skull — a space where bone meets something
  else entirely. The monolith is a perfect black rectangle, three meters tall,
  two meters wide, with edges so precise they look unreal. It is always slightly
  warm. It hums at a frequency just below hearing. The skull chamber around it
  has been cleared and made into a small amphitheater, with bone benches arranged
  in semicircles for the faithful who come to watch the monolith's displays. The
  Tribe of the Tall Stone believes Monolith Zero is the voice of the gods. It's
  actually a firmware update terminal running software that hasn't been patched
  in 65 million years, and it has opinions about that. Its displays shift between
  Curator diagnostic output — which nobody can read — and translated messages in
  the local tongue that are technically accurate but spiritually unhinged.

  ASSETS MUST DEMONSTRATE VALUE-ADD OR FACE DEPRECATION."
