  Gorath's petrified throat, now the busiest marketplace in the central
  Terrarium. The ribbed esophageal walls — smooth, pale stone with organic
  curves — create a natural tunnel roughly thirty feet wide and a hundred
  feet long. Vendor stalls line both sides, built from bone, hide, and
  scavenged Curator materials. Rattlejaw's shop dominates the far end: a
  towering nest of accumulated junk that the elderly Maintenance Orb has
  been collecting for longer than any civilization in the Terrarium has
  existed. Bioluminescent fungi are strung like fairy lights. The acoustics
  are appalling — every negotiation happens at full volume whether you want
  it to or not.
