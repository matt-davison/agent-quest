  Carved from Gorath's left femur — a bone so massive that the hollowed
  interior comfortably fits a tavern, an inn, and Old Magma's meditation
  alcove. The walls still faintly glow with residual bioluminescence, a
  warm amber light that makes everything feel ancient and comfortable. The
  Eternal Ember burns in a firepit at the center — a flame fed by gases
  seeping through hairline cracks in the bone, tended by Old Magma for
  longer than anyone can remember. Sleeping niches are carved into the
  walls at various heights, accessible by bone-rung ladders. The bar is
  a polished cross-section of rib bone, behind which fermenting fungal
  brews bubble in stone jars. It's warm, it's close, and Old Magma's
  stories make you forget you're living inside a dead monster.
