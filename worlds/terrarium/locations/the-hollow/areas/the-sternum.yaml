description: |
  The central plaza of The Hollow, built on Gorath's massive sternum bone. The
  bone has been worn smooth by generations of feet, stained dark with age and
  firelight. It's fifty feet wide and slopes gently upward toward the spine,
  where Grunk's throne — carved from a fused vertebra — overlooks everything.
  Bioluminescent fungi trail from the ribs overhead, casting shifting blue-green
  light that makes everything look slightly underwater. Fang's diplomatic
  pavilion occupies the eastern edge: dyed dinosaur hide stretched over bone
  poles, surprisingly elegant, with actual cushions. A carved bone message board
  near the center displays transcriptions of Monolith Zero's latest pronouncements,
  which nobody fully understands but everyone has opinions about.
