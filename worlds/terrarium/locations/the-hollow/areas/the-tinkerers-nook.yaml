  Wedged into the joint where two ribs meet the spine, accessible only by a
  bone-rung ladder that Skitter insists is "perfectly safe, probably." The
  Nook is a chaotic workspace crammed with Curator technology in various
  states of disassembly, hand-carved bone tools, glowing components that
  nobody should touch (but everyone does), and a workbench that Skitter
  has bolted, glued, and sworn at into structural integrity. Skitter
  themselves hovers in the center — a basketball-sized Maintenance Orb
  with a cracked CRT eye that displays emoticons, a slightly bent antenna,
  and a personality that oscillates between manic helpfulness and existential
  crisis. Sparks happen here. Explosions happen here. Progress, occasionally,
  also happens here.
