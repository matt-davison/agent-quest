# The Monolith Fields

> _The gods left voicemail._

## Description

East of The Hollow, the cavern floor opens into vast grasslands that stretch for miles beneath The Bulb's direct light. The grass is chest-high, bioluminescent at the tips, and ripples in waves driven by thermal currents from below. Scattered across these plains like teeth in an enormous jaw stand the monoliths — dozens of them, perfect black rectangles of various sizes, each humming its own subsonic note. Some are taller than buildings. Others are half-buried, tilted, or cracked. All of them glow faintly from within.

The Curators installed the monoliths as a communication and monitoring network. After 65 million years, most have degraded into repetitive status displays, but some still receive updates from Sub-Committee 7. The inhabitants of the Terrarium treat the Fields with a mixture of awe and practical wariness — the monoliths attract attention, and attention attracts predators. Snap-jaw packs hunt in the tall grass, Thornbacks graze the plains' edges, and the occasional Scaled Court patrol passes through on business that they are always very polite about not explaining.

On clear days during Fullglow, standing in the center of the Fields and looking up, you can see The Bulb — the artificial sun that lights the hollow earth — hanging impossibly far above. It looks like a second, closer sun. It makes you feel very small. The monoliths don't help.

## Points of Interest

### The Standing Ring
A circle of seven monoliths arranged in perfect geometric alignment. Each displays a different aspect of Project 42-B's status. During certain alignments, the monoliths project a holographic map of the entire Terrarium. The Titan Cult considers this sacred ground.

### The Fallen One
A massive monolith toppled on its side, cracked open. Its interior reveals crystal lattice structures and circuitry that defies understanding. Tinkers come here to scavenge Curator Trinkets from the exposed innards.

### The Whisper Stones
Smaller monoliths that have developed a peculiar acoustic property over the millennia — they amplify and repeat nearby sounds with a delay, creating an eerie whispering effect. Useful for eavesdropping. Terrible for stealth.

## Secrets

<details>
<summary>The Pattern</summary>

Visit five different monoliths and record their displays (Chronicler class or Curator Trinket required). The messages aren't random — they're coordinates. Plotted together, they reveal the location of Curator Station Sigma's main entrance, hidden behind a holographic cliff face. More importantly, they reveal that the monolith network is a nervous system, and something just woke it up.
