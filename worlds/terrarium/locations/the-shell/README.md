# The Shell

> _Up is a suggestion. Down is a memory._

## Description

The Shell is the inner surface of the hollow earth itself — the boundary between the Terrarium and whatever lies beyond. To reach it, you climb. And climb. And then gravity starts doing things gravity shouldn't do.

The approach begins normally enough — steep terrain rising from the Bonewood's western ridges, through barren rock and thinning atmosphere. But as you ascend toward the curving inner surface of the sphere, gravity begins to weaken, shift, and eventually invert. Near the Shell, you can stand on what was the ceiling and look "down" at the entire Terrarium spread below you — the glowing plains, the forests, the distant speck of The Hollow — with The Bulb hanging in the center of everything like a miniature sun suspended in a snow globe. It is simultaneously the most beautiful and most terrifying view in the world.

The Shell itself is rock and soil on the surface, but dig deep enough — as the Diggers have been trying to for generations — and you hit metal. Alien metal. The walls of the Terrarium aren't natural. They're engineered. The entire hollow earth is a constructed sphere, and the Shell is its hull. The Diggers know this. They've been trying to breach it. They believe there's something beyond. The Curators' blueprints, filed under "Project 42-B: Containment Specifications," simply note: "EXTERIOR: Space."

The gravity distortions make the Shell one of the most dangerous places in the Terrarium. Creatures adapted to the warped physics are faster and more unpredictable. The Bulb's radiation is stronger here — too close to the artificial sun. And the Shell itself occasionally shifts, sections sliding and rearranging in what the Curators' maintenance logs call "scheduled hull maintenance" but which everyone else calls "the ground trying to eat you."

## Points of Interest

### The Digger Camps
Scattered settlements of the Digger faction, clinging to the Shell's inner surface in defiance of gravity and common sense. Their tunnels go deep into the metal hull, illuminated by stolen Curator tech. They're close to breaking through. They have been "close" for three generations.

### The Bulb Approach
The closest accessible point to The Bulb. The artificial sun hangs in the center of the hollow sphere, and from the Shell, it's almost close enough to touch (it isn't). The light and heat here are intense. Curator warning beacons flash constantly. Something about the view — the entire world laid out below, the impossible sun above — changes people.

### The Hull Breach
One spot where the Diggers actually broke through the inner metal layer. What they found behind it: another metal layer. And behind that: another. And behind that: a gap filled with machinery, wiring, and a Maintenance Orb that was very surprised to see them.

## Secrets

<details>
<summary>The Outside</summary>

At level 9+, help the Diggers complete their breach. Behind the layers of hull metal, behind the machinery and wiring, there is a viewport. A small, circular window of transparent material that the Curators installed for quality inspection purposes. Look through it. Outside the Terrarium is a cavern — a real, natural cavern, deep beneath the Earth's surface. And in that cavern, visible in the distance, is another sphere. Another Terrarium. Project 42-A. The "control group." It's dark. It has been dark for a very long time. "Decommissioned."
