# The Sulphur Pools

> _Watch your step. Watch your lungs. Watch the eggs._

## Description

South of The Hollow, the cavern floor drops into a shallow depression where geothermal vents break through the rock in a network of steaming pools, bubbling mud pits, and mineral-crusted hot springs. The air is thick with sulphur and warm moisture. Bioluminescent algae thrive in the heated water, turning the pools into shifting patterns of orange, green, and vivid blue. Steam rises in curtains that catch The Bulb's light and scatter it into rainbows that exist nowhere else in the Terrarium.

This is also one of the largest dinosaur nesting grounds in the central region. The warm ground and heated pools create ideal incubation conditions, and dozens of species lay their eggs here. The nesting mothers are not hostile by default — but they are extremely protective. Give the nests wide berth, speak softly, and whatever you do, don't touch the eggs.

The Sulphur Pools are the gentlest wilderness area near The Hollow, making them the traditional first journey for new members of the Tribe. The tutorial quest sends you here. The hot springs are genuinely therapeutic, the mineral deposits are valuable, and the danger is manageable — as long as you respect the mothers.

## Points of Interest

### The Warm Shallows
A series of interconnected pools at comfortable bathing temperature. The minerals in the water have genuine healing properties. Travelers come here to rest and recover.

### The Central Nesting Ground
The largest concentration of nests, arranged in concentric rings by species. A massive matriarch — an ancient herbivorous dinosaur the locals call "Grandmother" — oversees the nesting ground. She's been here longer than the Tribe.

### The Crystal Vents
Where superheated mineral water cools rapidly against cold rock, creating formations of crystallized minerals. Beautiful, valuable, and occasionally unstable — approach with caution.

## Secrets

<details>
<summary>The Egg Keeper</summary>

As a Beastwhisperer, approach the central nesting ground peacefully. Grandmother — the ancient matriarch — will acknowledge your bond with fauna. She allows you to witness the hatching, and one of the juvenile dinosaurs imprints on you. This is how Beastwhisperers in the Terrarium have bonded with companions for generations. The species of your companion depends on what's hatching when you arrive.
