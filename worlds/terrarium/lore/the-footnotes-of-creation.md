## Project 42-B: A History in Internal Communications

What follows is a reconstruction of the Terrarium's history, pieced together from Curator Memos found embedded in monoliths, scattered across debris fields, and hoarded by Maintenance Orbs who didn't know what they were saving but saved everything anyway. The memos have been translated from Curator script. Some nuance may be lost. Most of the nuance was probably lost before translation.

### Memo: Project Inception

**FROM:** Senior Curator Vex-7, Ecosystem Design Division
**TO:** Sub-Committee 7, Planetary Resource Allocation
**RE:** Proposal — Project 42-B: Sentient Life Viability Study
**DATE:** Approximately 65,000,042 cycles ago

> We propose the construction of an enclosed ecosystem within the hollow geological formation designated "Cavity Terrarium-7" on the third planet of the Sol system. The ecosystem will be seeded with representative species from the planet's current biosphere and monitored for the development of sentient life under controlled conditions.
>
> Budget: 14.7 trillion standard resource units.
> Timeline: Ongoing (estimated minimum viable data collection: 50 million cycles).
> Expected ROI: Incalculable, which I am told is the wrong answer for a budget proposal.
>
> The project will be illuminated by an artificial bioluminescent sun (designation: "The Bulb"). I am aware this name lacks gravitas. I am the Senior Curator. I can call it whatever I want.

**STATUS:** APPROVED (with budget concerns noted)

### Memo: The Asteroid

**FROM:** Sub-Committee 7, Oversight Division
**TO:** Senior Curator Vex-7
**RE:** Surface Biosphere Contamination Concern
**DATE:** Approximately 65,000,000 cycles ago

> The surface biosphere has developed to a degree that may contaminate Project 42-B's control conditions through geological migration. We recommend a surface reset.
>
> Proposed method: Directed asteroid impact (see attachment: "Rock_Drop_v3_FINAL_final_APPROVED.xlsx").
>
> Note: Some Sub-Committee members expressed concern about the ethical implications of sterilizing a planetary surface. These concerns were noted and filed under "Acknowledged Feedback (Non-Actionable)."

**STATUS:** APPROVED

**ANNOTATION (later, unsigned):** The asteroid worked. The surface biosphere reset to zero. Project 42-B was sealed and continued operation. The Bulb held. Nobody mentioned the ethical concerns again. There was cake in the break room.

### Memo: First Sentient Species

**FROM:** Research Station Sigma, Biology Wing
**TO:** Sub-Committee 7
**RE:** Milestone Achievement — Sentient Life Detected
**DATE:** Approximately 2,000,000 cycles ago

> We are pleased to report that multiple species within the Terrarium have crossed the sentience threshold as defined in Section 4.2.1 of the Project Brief. Notable developments include:
>
> - **Variant Phenotype Group "Saurian-Alpha"**: Intelligent reptilian species demonstrating language, tool use, social hierarchy, and what appears to be a judicial system. They have developed formal diplomacy. They wear accessories.
> - **Variant Phenotype Group "Primate-Beta"**: Bipedal warm-blooded species demonstrating language, fire use, tribal organization, and a tendency to name their weapons.
>
> We recommend continued observation without interference.

**STATUS:** ACKNOWLEDGED

### Memo: Unscheduled Mutation Event

**FROM:** Research Station Sigma, Emergency Division
**TO:** ALL CURATORS
**RE:** URGENT — Specimen T-001 Classification
**DATE:** Approximately 50,000,000 cycles ago

> Something has gone wrong in Sector 7.
>
> A specimen has grown to a size not predicted by any model. Current measurements: approximately 800 meters in length, 200 meters in height. It is still growing. Our models predicted maximum megafauna size at 30 meters. This is 30 meters times 26.67. We are concerned.
>
> Classification: Unscheduled Mutation, Category — COLOSSAL
> Designation: Specimen T-001
> Colloquial name among staff: "Oh no."
>
> The specimen appears to be heading toward the central Terrarium. We are unsure how to stop it. We are unsure if we should stop it. We are unsure of many things.

**STATUS:** CONTAINMENT ATTEMPTED (PARTIAL SUCCESS — Specimen T-001 entered dormancy after consuming approximately 40% of Sector 7's biomass)

**ANNOTATION:** Specimen T-001 eventually died. Or went dormant. Or something in between. A primitive settlement was later built inside its ribcage. The inhabitants worship a monolith embedded in its skull. This was not in the project brief.

### Memo: The Bulb Maintenance Incident

**FROM:** Maintenance Division, Lighting Subdepartment
**TO:** Sub-Committee 7
**RE:** The Bulb — Routine Maintenance Report (Cycle 41)
**DATE:** 1 cycle ago

> Routine diagnostic on The Bulb reveals degradation of the primary bioluminescent matrix at a rate of 0.0003% per cycle. At current rates, total failure will occur in approximately 12,000 cycles. This is well within acceptable parameters.
>
> However, we note that the secondary matrix — the backup — was decommissioned in Cycle 6 as a cost-saving measure. This means there is no redundancy.
>
> We recommend budget allocation for secondary matrix restoration.

**STATUS:** BUDGET ALLOCATION DENIED ("Not a priority at this time.")

**ANNOTATION:** This is fine.

### Memo: The Final Review

**FROM:** Sub-Committee 7, Oversight Division
**TO:** ALL CURATORS — PROJECT 42-B
**RE:** Scheduled Performance Review — Project 42-B
**DATE:** Current cycle

> In accordance with Resource Allocation Policy 7.4.1, all long-running projects must demonstrate measurable value during scheduled review periods. Project 42-B is now 65 million cycles into a 50-million-cycle projected timeline with no extraction of usable data.
>
> A Final Review has been scheduled for Cycle 42, Month 6, Day 12.
>
> All assets must demonstrate value-add or face deprecation.
>
> "Deprecation" in this context means: decommissioning of the enclosed ecosystem, including all biological and mechanical assets, and repurposing of the geological formation for a new project.
>
> This is a standard process. Please do not panic.
>
> (Note: The preceding sentence is procedural. It is not advice. You may panic if you wish. Sub-Committee 7 will not judge. Sub-Committee 7 does not have feelings.)

**STATUS:** ACTIVE — 42 days remaining

### Memo: Dissenting Opinion

**FROM:** [REDACTED], formerly of Research Station Sigma
**TO:** [UNKNOWN RECIPIENT]
**RE:** Project 42-B Must Not Be Decommissioned
**DATE:** Recent (exact date unclear)

> To whoever finds this:
>
> I have been monitoring Project 42-B from outside the official oversight structure. What I have observed exceeds every parameter in the original brief. The ecosystem has not merely achieved viability — it has achieved complexity. Beauty. Meaning.
>
> Species that were meant to compete have learned to cooperate. A reptilian civilization developed diplomacy before warfare. A primate tribe built a home inside a creature that could have destroyed them, and learned to live there in peace. A maintenance unit developed a personality and chose to protect beings it was never programmed to care about.
>
> This was supposed to fail. It didn't.
>
> Sub-Committee 7 does not care about beauty. It cares about deliverables. But I am recording this because someone should know: Project 42-B is not a failure. It is the most remarkable thing we have ever created.
>
> And they are going to destroy it in 42 days.
>
> Unless someone stops them.

**STATUS:** CLASSIFIED

## Notes for Chroniclers

The Footnotes of Creation are fragments. More memos exist, buried in monoliths, cached in Maintenance Orb memory banks, and archived in the depths of Curator Station Sigma. Every Curator Memo item found by players adds to this history. The full truth of the Terrarium's creation — and the full story of why it might end — is distributed across the world, waiting to be assembled.

The Guide has opinions about all of this. Most of them include the phrase "this is fine" in a tone that suggests it is not fine at all.
