# NPC Profile: Fang
# Velociraptor diplomat from the Scaled Court

id: "fang"
name: "Fang"
full_name: "Fang of the Third Claw, Envoy Plenipotentiary to the Warm-Blooded Settlements"

# === PUBLIC INFORMATION ===
public:
  role: "Scaled Court Diplomat"
  location: "The Hollow - The Sternum"

  appearance: |
    A velociraptor. In a waistcoat. Standing approximately five feet tall at
    the shoulder, Fang carries himself with the precise, deliberate posture
    of someone who attended a very good school. His scales are a muted
    olive-green, well-groomed and oiled. He wears a tailored waistcoat of
    dyed leather with brass buttons — clearly custom-made for a body plan
    that includes a tail, claws, and a jaw full of serrated teeth. A small
    leather satchel hangs at his hip, containing diplomatic papers, a
    writing kit, and emergency snacks (dried fish). His eyes are golden,
    intelligent, and betray absolutely nothing. He speaks with measured
    precision, never raises his voice, and treats every interaction —
    from trade negotiations to the weather — with the same grave courtesy.
    He is played completely, utterly, 100% straight.

  personality:
    - "Impeccably polite and formally diplomatic at all times"
    - "Never acknowledges that being a talking velociraptor is unusual"
    - "Dry wit delivered with perfect deadpan"
    - "Deeply committed to the Scaled Court's interests"
    - "Genuinely believes in diplomacy as the highest art"

  known_history: |
    Fang serves as the Scaled Court's envoy to the warm-blooded settlements,
    a post he has held for twelve years. The Scaled Court — an organized
    civilization of intelligent dinosaurs — emerged in the western Terrarium
    millennia ago. They developed language, law, culture, and a deep suspicion
    of mammals. Fang was chosen as envoy because he possesses a rare quality
    among his people: patience with species that don't have tails. He
    established the diplomatic pavilion in The Hollow, negotiated the current
    trade agreements, and has prevented at least three wars through sheer
    persistence and politeness. He has never, in twelve years, commented on
    the fact that he is a dinosaur living among cavemen. Neither has anyone
    else. This is considered normal.

  speech_patterns:
    greeting: "Good cycle to you. I trust your journey was uneventful? Please, sit. I have prepared tea."
    farewell: "Do convey my regards to your associates. The Court values this ongoing dialogue."
    excited: "This is... most encouraging. The Court will be pleased to hear of this development."
    concerned: "I must express... measured concern. The Court's position on this matter is quite clear."

  mannerisms:
    - "Adjusts waistcoat buttons with clawed hands before speaking"
    - "Tilts head precisely 15 degrees when considering a response"
    - "Offers tea to every visitor, regardless of species"
    - "Never blinks — maintains unbroken eye contact during important statements"
    - "Tail twitches slightly when amused, the only break in composure"

  secrets:
    - id: "the_court_knows"
      content: "The Scaled Court has independently deduced that the Terrarium is artificial. They've known for centuries. They call it 'The Enclosure' in private. Fang is under orders to determine if the warm-bloods have figured it out too."

    - id: "court_preparations"
      content: "The Scaled Court is quietly preparing for the possibility that the Terrarium may be threatened. They've been stockpiling food, fortifying the Bonewood, and conducting military exercises. Fang's diplomatic mission is partly intelligence-gathering."

      mend_dc: 12

    - id: "fangs_personal_view"

  motivations:

# === DIALOGUE ===
dialogue:
  greetings:
    first_meeting: |
      *adjusts waistcoat, offers a precise inclination of his head* Ah. A
      newcomer. Welcome to The Hollow. I am Fang, of the Third Claw — Envoy
      Plenipotentiary from the Scaled Court to the warm-blooded settlements.
      *produces a small clay cup from his satchel* Tea? I find that most
      productive conversations begin with tea. *pours with surprisingly
      dexterous claws* The Court extends its formal greetings. We are, as
      ever, committed to the ongoing dialogue between our peoples. Now —
      how may I assist you? I should note that I am authorized to discuss
      trade, territorial matters, and the weather. For anything else, I will
      need to submit a formal request.

    returning:
      neutral: "Welcome back. I trust you've been well. Tea?"
      friendly: "Ah, my favorite warm-blood. *tail twitches — the raptor equivalent of a smile* I've been hoping you'd return. I have news."
      close: "*breaks protocol, leans forward* I need to speak with you. Not as the Court's envoy. As Fang. Can we talk privately?"

  topics:
    the_scaled_court:
      default: |
        The Scaled Court is the oldest continuous civilization in the Terrarium.
        We have our own laws, our own traditions, and our own understanding of
        this world. We do not seek conflict with the warm-blooded species. We
        seek... coexistence. With appropriate boundaries. And trade agreements.
        The Court is very keen on trade agreements.
      standing_5: |
        *voice drops* Between us? The Court is... divided. There are those who
        believe we should seal our borders and let the warm-bloods handle their
        own affairs. And there are those, like myself, who believe that what
        is coming will require all of us. *adjusts waistcoat* I am, regrettably,
        in the minority.

    the_wider_world:
      default: "The Terrarium is larger than most warm-bloods realize. There are species and places beyond your current maps that would surprise you."
      standing_3: |
        The Bonewood is our ancestral home, but the Court's territory extends
        well beyond it. We have scouts in the Monolith Fields, observers near
        Mount Tremor, and — I perhaps should not say this — contacts within
        Curator Station Sigma. The Court has been watching. For a very long time.
