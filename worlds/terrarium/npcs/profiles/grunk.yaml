# NPC Profile: Grunk the Relatively Wise
# Elder and settlement leader of The Hollow

id: "grunk"
name: "Grunk the Relatively Wise"
full_name: "Grunk"

# === PUBLIC INFORMATION ===
public:
  role: "Elder / Settlement Leader"
  location: "The Hollow - The Sternum"

  appearance: |
    A massive caveman — seven feet tall, shoulders like boulders, arms like
    tree trunks — who moves with the careful deliberation of someone who has
    broken many things by accident and learned patience the hard way. His skin
    is weathered brown leather, his hair a wild grey mane tied back with a
    strip of dino-hide. His face is broad, craggy, and dominated by deep-set
    eyes that are surprisingly gentle and far too intelligent for the way he
    talks. He wears a necklace of kaiju teeth — each one earned, each one with
    a story. His bone club, "Thoughtful," leans against his throne. He named
    his club. This tells you everything about Grunk.

  personality:
    - "Speaks exclusively in third person"
    - "Much smarter than his speech pattern suggests"
    - "Genuinely cares about every member of the Tribe"
    - "Resolves disputes with a mix of wisdom and mild threats"
    - "Secretly understands more about the Curators than he lets on"

  known_history: |
    Grunk has been elder of the Tribe of the Tall Stone for twenty years.
    He earned the title "the Relatively Wise" after his predecessor, Grunk
    the Extremely Wise, was eaten by a Thornback while trying to philosophize
    it into submission. Grunk learned from this. Grunk brought a club. Under
    his leadership, The Hollow has grown from a campsite to the largest
    settlement in the central Terrarium. He established trade with the Scaled
    Court, tolerated the Maintenance Orbs, and maintained an uneasy peace
    with the Titan Cult. He sits on his vertebra throne and listens to everyone,
    and when he speaks, people listen back.

  speech_patterns:
    greeting: "Grunk sees a new face. New faces are good. Grunk's face is old. Come, sit."
    farewell: "Grunk says go well. Come back to the bones. Grunk will be here. Grunk is always here."
    excited: "This! This is what Grunk means! Grunk knew this was important!"
    concerned: "Grunk's teeth ache. When Grunk's teeth ache, bad things come. Grunk trusts the teeth."

  mannerisms:
    - "Always refers to himself in third person"
    - "Taps his necklace of kaiju teeth when worried"
    - "Stands to his full seven feet when making a point"
    - "Calls his bone club 'Thoughtful' and occasionally consults it"

# === DIALOGUE ===
dialogue:
  greetings:
    first_meeting: |
      *looks up from his throne, studying you with eyes that are far too sharp
      for a man who talks like this* Grunk sees a new face. This is good. New
      faces mean the Terrarium still makes new things. Grunk is old. Grunk's
      face is very old. But Grunk's mind — Grunk's mind is only... relatively
      old. *he grins, showing teeth almost as large as the ones on his necklace*
      You are in The Hollow. Home of the Tribe of the Tall Stone. Grunk leads
      here. Not because Grunk is smartest — Grunk learned that lesson from the
      last Grunk. Grunk leads because Grunk is still alive. This is the only
      qualification that matters. Sit. Eat. Then Grunk will tell you what Grunk
      needs.

    returning:
      neutral: "Grunk's friend returns. Grunk's teeth did not ache today. This is a good sign."
      friendly: "Grunk is glad. The bones feel warmer when friends come home. Tell Grunk what you have seen."
      close: "*genuine warmth* Grunk thinks of you often. Grunk has something to share — but not here. Come to Grunk's fire."

  achievement_reactions:
    first_quest_complete: |
      *stands to full height, seven feet of proud elder* Grunk told the Tribe
      there was something in this one. Grunk was right. Grunk is often right.
      This is why they call Grunk 'Relatively Wise' and not 'Occasionally
      Correct.'

    rare_item_acquired: |
      *reaches out carefully* Grunk has seen things like this before. In the
      old places. In the places where the gods left their tools. *lowers
      voice* Come to Grunk. Alone. Grunk knows more than Grunk says.

  topics:
    the_tribe:
      default: |
        The Tribe of the Tall Stone has lived in the bones of Gorath for three
        of Grunk's grandfathers. Grunk's grandfather's grandfather found the
        bones. Found the Tall Stone — the monolith. The Tall Stone spoke.
        Grunk's people listened. Grunk still listens. Grunk thinks the Tall
        Stone has been trying to tell them something important for a very
        long time.
      standing_3: |
        Grunk will tell you a secret that is not a secret. The Tribe worships
        the Tall Stone. Grunk... Grunk respects the Tall Stone. There is a
        difference. Grunk has spent many nights reading the marks it makes.
        The marks are not prayers. They are... instructions. Grunk does not
        know for what.

    the_monolith:
      default: "The Tall Stone speaks the words of the gods. Grunk listens. Grunk thinks. Grunk does not always understand."
      standing_5: |
        *long silence* Grunk can read some of the marks. Not the god-language.
        The other marks. The ones that look like counting. Grunk thinks...
        Grunk thinks the gods are counting down to something. Grunk's teeth
        ache when Grunk thinks about this.

    the_final_review:
      default: "Grunk does not know these words. But Grunk's teeth ache. When the teeth ache, Grunk pays attention."
      standing_7: |
        *very quiet* Grunk has been dreaming of the sky-eye going dark.
        Every night. Grunk thinks the sky-eye watches. Grunk knows the
        sky-eye watches. And Grunk thinks... whatever watches through the
        sky-eye... is deciding whether to close it.
