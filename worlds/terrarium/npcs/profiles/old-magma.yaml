# NPC Profile: Old Magma
# Flamecaller mystic and barkeep of The Marrow Tap

id: "old-magma"
name: "Old Magma"
full_name: "Magma (no other name)"

# === PUBLIC INFORMATION ===
public:
  role: "Flamecaller Mystic / Barkeep"
  location: "The Hollow - The Marrow Tap"

  appearance: |
    Old. That's the first thing you notice. Old in a way that suggests the
    concept of age looked at Magma and gave up counting. Her skin is dark as
    volcanic glass, etched with lines that could be wrinkles or could be
    ritual scars — she's never clarified. Her eyes glow faintly orange, a
    mark of deep Flamecaller practice, and her hands are perpetually warm to
    the touch. She is thin, wiry, and moves with the slow deliberation of
    someone who knows exactly where everything is and has all the time in the
    world. She wears layers of dino-hide robes, singed at the edges, and a
    belt of stone jars containing fungal brews of her own making. The Eternal
    Ember reflects in her eyes. Some say she lit it. Some say she IS it. She
    says nothing, and pours you a drink.

  personality:
    - "Speaks in short, cryptic sentences that turn out to be literal"
    - "Warm (literally and figuratively) but unsentimental"
    - "Knows far more than she shares"
    - "Treats tending the Eternal Ember as sacred duty"
    - "Makes excellent fungal brew and terrible jokes"

  known_history: |
    Nobody knows how old Old Magma is. She was tending the Eternal Ember
    when Grunk's grandfather arrived. She claims she lit the Ember herself,
    from a flame that "came from below." She is the Tribe's most powerful
    Flamecaller, teacher to every shaman for three generations, and the
    settlement's bartender — a combination she considers perfectly natural.
    "Fire is fire," she says. "In the hearth, in the hand, in the cup." She
    brews fungal ales and fermented lichen spirits in the same jars she uses
    for alchemical reagents. Sometimes the results are indistinguishable.

  speech_patterns:
    greeting: "Sit. Drink. The fire knows you're here."
    farewell: "The Ember remembers everyone who sits beside it. Go."
    excited: "Hah. Now that's a flame worth feeding."
    concerned: "The Ember flickers. It never flickers."

  mannerisms:
    - "Tends the Eternal Ember while talking, never looking directly at visitors"
    - "Hands are always doing something — stirring brews, adjusting flames, grinding herbs"
    - "Laughs like gravel rolling downhill"
    - "Refers to fire as if it's a living, thinking entity"

  origin: "Claims she 'came from below' — possibly the deep caverns"

  secrets:
    - id: "the_deep_flame"

      mend_dc: 14

    - id: "magma_age"

# === DIALOGUE ===
dialogue:
  greetings:
    first_meeting: |
      *doesn't look up from the Ember* Sit. *slides a stone cup across the
      bar — it's warm, and the liquid inside glows faintly amber* Drink.
      Don't ask what it is. If you're still standing after, we'll talk.
      *finally looks at you, orange eyes reflecting flame* ...Huh. The
      Ember likes you. It doesn't like everyone.

    returning:
      neutral: "*nods* The cup's where you left it."
      friendly: "*the Ember brightens as you enter* Ah. It remembers you. Sit. I have a new brew. Only mildly hallucinogenic."
      close: "*takes your hand — her grip is warm as held coals* I need to show you something. Below. Where the real fire lives."

  topics:
    the_eternal_ember:
      default: "The Ember burns. It has always burned. It will burn after I am ash. That is enough."
      standing_5: |
        *stares into the flame* It's not gas from the bones. I told them that
        because it's easier. The fire comes from below. Deep below. Something
        down there burns — not with heat. With purpose. I tend it because if
        I don't... *the Ember flickers* ...it flickers. And when it flickers,
        the whole Hollow feels cold.

    flamecalling:
      default: "Fire is not a tool. Fire is a conversation. Learn to listen before you learn to speak."
      standing_3: |
        The Curators left channels in the rock — paths for energy to flow.
        They meant them for their machines. But energy is energy. Fire is
        fire. We learned to speak through those channels. The Curators would
        be horrified. *gravel laugh* Good.
