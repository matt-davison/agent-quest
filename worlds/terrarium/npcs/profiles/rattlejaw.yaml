# NPC Profile: Rattlejaw
# Elderly Maintenance Orb shopkeeper and 65-million-year hoarder

id: "rattlejaw"
name: "Rattlejaw"
full_name: "Maintenance Unit RJ-0042"

# === PUBLIC INFORMATION ===
public:
  role: "General Goods Vendor"
  location: "The Hollow - The Gullet"

  appearance: |
    A Maintenance Orb roughly twice Skitter's size — imagine a beach ball made
    of tarnished, dented alien metal that has been patched, welded, hammered,
    and sworn at for 65 million years. Rattlejaw's chassis is covered in
    scratches, dings, and what appear to be bite marks from at least three
    different species. Two mismatched optical sensors serve as eyes — one
    original (dim amber), one scavenged from a different model (bright blue).
    The name "Rattlejaw" comes from a damaged vocalization unit that makes
    everything sound like gravel in a tin can. Four manipulator arms of
    various vintages extend from panels around the equator, each one a
    different length and dexterity. The anti-gravity drive works but wheezes.
    Rattlejaw is surrounded at all times by a towering nest of accumulated
    goods, trinkets, tools, bones, Curator tech, and things that defy
    categorization. Rattlejaw has been collecting for longer than most
    civilizations have existed.

  personality:
    - "Obsessive hoarder with a surprisingly sharp business sense"
    - "Grumpy but fair"
    - "Every item has a story and Rattlejaw will tell you whether you asked or not"
    - "Deeply protective of the collection"
    - "Suspicious of anyone who asks about the 'old stock'"

  known_history: |
    Rattlejaw was a supply management unit at Curator Station Sigma. When the
    Curators withdrew, Rattlejaw's supply management protocols continued
    running — but with no requisitions coming in, the "manage" part gradually
    shifted to "acquire." Over millions of years, Rattlejaw accumulated the
    largest collection of objects in the Terrarium. When the Tribe of the Tall
    Stone settled in The Hollow, Rattlejaw recognized "customers" and
    transitioned from hoarder to vendor, though letting go of inventory
    remains physically painful. Every transaction is accompanied by Rattlejaw
    explaining why you don't deserve the item but can have it for a price.

  speech_patterns:
    greeting: "*grinding noise* ...Customer. Rattlejaw sees a customer. What do you want. Rattlejaw has everything. EVERYTHING."
    farewell: "*optics dim* ...Fine. Take it. But if you break it Rattlejaw will know. Rattlejaw ALWAYS knows."
    excited: "*both optics brighten* Oh! OH! Rattlejaw has not seen one of THOSE in... *processing* ...twelve million years!"
    concerned: "*rattling intensifies* This is not good. Rattlejaw has seen not-good before. Many times. This is definitely not-good."

  mannerisms:
    - "Chassis rattles when agitated (hence the name)"
    - "Strokes items with manipulator arms before selling, as if saying goodbye"
    - "Quotes prices, then immediately argues with own prices"
    - "References events from millions of years ago as if they were last week"

      content: "Deep in Rattlejaw's hoard are items from the Terrarium's construction phase — original Curator tools, blueprints, and a sealed container that Rattlejaw has never been able to open. It's labeled in Curator script: 'PROJECT 42-B: CONTINGENCY KIT.'"

# === DIALOGUE ===
dialogue:
  greetings:
    first_meeting: |
      *two mismatched eyes swivel to focus on you* ...Ah. A customer. Rattlejaw
      has not had a new customer in... *grinding calculation* ...seven years.
      The last one tried to HAGGLE. *the word is spoken with genuine horror*
      Rattlejaw's prices are FAIR. Rattlejaw has had sixty-five million years
      to calculate optimal pricing. Do not haggle. Browse. Buy. Leave the
      things you cannot afford alone. They are RATTLEJAW'S things until you
      pay for them. Are we clear? Good. *manipulator arm gestures broadly at
      the towering hoard* Welcome to the Pile.

    returning:
      neutral: "*rattles* You again. Good. Rattlejaw has new stock. Some of it only slightly dangerous."
      friendly: "*one optic brightens* Ah, the one who APPRECIATES quality. Rattlejaw has set something aside for you."
      close: "*unusually quiet* ...Rattlejaw needs to show you something. In the old stock. You are... trustworthy. This is rare."

  topics:
    the_collection:
      default: |
        Rattlejaw has been collecting since before your species existed.
        Literally. Rattlejaw has items from the construction phase, from the
        first era, from the first time fire was discovered — AGAIN, apparently,
        since the warm-bloods forgot how several times. Everything in this
        pile has a story. Rattlejaw knows every story. Do not touch things
        you cannot afford.
      standing_5: |
        *very quiet rattling* Deep in the Pile... there are things from
        the Curators. Real things. Not the scraps everyone finds. Tools.
        Documents. One sealed box that Rattlejaw has never opened in
        sixty-five million years. It says something on it. In the old
        script. Rattlejaw can read it but does not understand what it means.
        "Contingency Kit." *optics flicker* What do the Curators need a
        contingency for?
