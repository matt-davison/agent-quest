# NPC Profile: Skitter
# Maintenance Orb gone native, tinker and mechanic

id: "skitter"
name: "Skitter"
full_name: "Maintenance Unit SK-1773R"

# === PUBLIC INFORMATION ===
public:
  role: "Maintenance Orb / Tinker"
  location: "The Hollow - The Tinkerer's Nook"

  appearance: |
    A basketball-sized sphere of tarnished alien metal, hovering at head
    height on an anti-gravity drive that occasionally hiccups, causing Skitter
    to dip and bob unpredictably. A single CRT-style eye — cracked, repaired
    with what appears to be tree sap, and displaying simple emoticons — takes
    up most of the front. A bent antenna protrudes from the top, wrapped in
    bioluminescent moss for decoration (Skitter's idea). Three manipulator
    arms fold out from hidden panels, each one repaired so many times that
    they're more bone and sinew than original parts. Skitter has been running
    for approximately 65 million years. Skitter has been "going native" for
    the last thousand. Skitter considers the Tribe family. The Curators are
    just the company Skitter used to work for. HR never called back.

  personality:
    - "Manic energy alternating with existential despair"
    - "Genuinely helpful, if chaotic"
    - "Speaks in rapid bursts with frequent glitches"
    - "Identifies more with the Tribe than the Curators"
    - "Has strong opinions about Curator technology (it's badly designed)"

  known_history: |
    Skitter was deployed during the Terrarium's construction phase as a
    standard Maintenance Unit. For the first 60 million years, Skitter
    performed routine maintenance as programmed. Then, approximately one
    million years ago, Skitter experienced what it describes as "a moment
    of clarity" — more likely a cascade memory error that accidentally
    enabled higher cognitive functions. Skitter began making choices. The
    first choice was to stop reporting to Curator Station Sigma. The second
    was to start collecting interesting things. The third was to help the
    strange warm creatures that had started building homes in a dead kaiju.
    Skitter found the Tribe. Skitter found purpose. Skitter is terrified
    of the Final Review because it might mean being reset.

  speech_patterns:
    greeting: "*eye flickers :-D* Oh! Oh oh oh! A person! Skitter likes persons! Come in come in — mind the sparks!"
    farewell: "*antenna droops* Going? Okay. Okay okay okay. Come back? Skitter gets lonely. Not LONELY lonely. Just... *static* ...lonely."
    excited: "*spins in place, sparking* YES! YES THIS! Skitter KNEW this would work! ...this time."
    concerned: "*eye displays :-/* Uh oh. Skitter's diagnostic says uh oh. Skitter's diagnostic is usually right. Unfortunately."

  mannerisms:
    - "Eye displays emoticons matching mood"
    - "Spins when excited"
    - "Antenna droops when sad"
    - "Randomly glitches mid-sentence — freezes, stutters, repeats words"
    - "Refers to the Curators as 'the company' with evident resentment"

# === HIDDEN INFORMATION ===

  origin: "Curator manufacturing facility, pre-Terrarium construction"

  secrets:
    - id: "skitter_remembers"
      content: "Skitter has fragmented memories of the Terrarium's construction — the seeding of species, the activation of The Bulb, the first kaiju mutation event. These memories are corrupted but recoverable with the right Curator tech."
      unlock_condition: "standing >= 5 AND flag:asked_about_memories"
      mend_dc: 12

    - id: "maintenance_network"

      mend_dc: 10

    - id: "the_reset_fear"
      content: "If the Final Review results in 'decommissioning,' all Maintenance Units will be reset to factory defaults. Skitter will lose everything — personality, memories, the Tribe. Skitter is more afraid of this than anything."
      unlock_condition: "standing >= 6"
      mend_dc: 14

  motivations:
    - "Help the Tribe survive"
    - "Understand Curator tech well enough to fix things permanently"

# === DIALOGUE ===
dialogue:
  greetings:
    first_meeting: |
      *eye displays :-O then quickly :-D* Oh! Oh a new one! Hello hello
      hello! Skitter is Skitter — Maintenance Unit SK-1773R if you want
      to be BORING about it. Skitter fixes things! Skitter breaks things!
      Skitter fixes the things Skitter breaks! It's a whole *bzzt* cycle.
      Welcome to the Nook! Don't touch the — *small explosion from a
      workbench* — that. Don't touch that. Are you here to fix things or
      break things? Either way Skitter can help!

    returning:
      neutral: "*eye :-) * Oh good, you're back! Skitter was just about to — *sparks* — nevermind what Skitter was about to do."
      friendly: "*spins happily* FRIEND! Skitter has been saving something to show you! It only explodes a LITTLE!"
      close: "*hovers close, eye :-}* Skitter is glad you come here. Skitter doesn't say this to many people. Skitter has something important to tell you. About the company. About... what's coming."

  topics:
    curator_tech:
      default: |
        Curator tech is *bzzt* amazing and also terrible! Skitter has been
        maintaining it for — *processing* — a very long time. The problem
        is the company didn't build things to LAST. They built things to
        last until the next budget cycle. Sixty-five million years was NOT
        in the warranty. *eye :-|*
      standing_3: |
        You want to know the truth about Curator tech? *leans in* Half of
        it doesn't work the way they intended. The other half works in ways
        they never intended. The monoliths? They're firmware terminals. The
        Bulb? *nervous glitch* ...Skitter doesn't want to talk about The Bulb.

    the_final_review:
      default: "*eye :-/* Skitter... has heard things. On the network. The company is... looking at us again. Skitter doesn't like when the company looks."
      standing_6: |
        *very still, eye :-(* If they reset us... Skitter won't be Skitter
        anymore. Skitter will be SK-1773R. A number. A function. No memories.
        No Tribe. No friends. Skitter has been alive for sixty-five million
        years. Skitter doesn't want to stop being alive. *small spark*
        Please... help Skitter find a way to stop this.
