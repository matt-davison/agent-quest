backstory: |
  Caroline was born into the Tribe of the Tall Stone with her father's smile
  and her mother's empathy — the deep kind, the kind that lets you feel what
  the megafauna feel when they rumble past in the bioluminescent dark. She was
  happy. Then the leprosy came, patches of numbness spreading across her skin
  like a map of places she couldn't feel anymore. Her father, Torq, a
  respected hunter, couldn't bear to watch it happen. He left one morning
  before The Bulb brightened, leaving only his bone-tooth necklace and a note
  scratched into bark: "Forgive me. I am not strong enough for this."

  The tribe didn't exile her — they're not cruel, just awkward about it. She
  drifted to the edges, where the megafauna graze. Turns out, a triceratops
  doesn't care about your skin. A juvenile stegosaur just wants someone to
  scratch behind its plates. Caroline found more honest connection with the
  great beasts than she ever had with people, though she never stopped wanting
  both. She describes herself as "a lover" — of creatures, of the world, of
  the idea that everything alive deserves to be touched gently. She is
  left-handed, which the Tribe considers either lucky or cursed depending on
  who you ask. She smokes fungal cannabis rolled in dinosaur-hide paper and
  insists it helps her "attune to the pheromone frequencies." It might.

    detail: |
      The warmth of the Eternal Ember reached deeper than Caroline expected.
      Old Magma took her scarred hand without flinching — the first person in
      The Hollow to touch her willingly. The old Flamecaller smelled the
      Dreamer's Cap on her and approved. Something loosened in Caroline's chest.
      She wasn't just tolerated here. She was seen.

    event: "Calmed a starving snap-jaw and named it Bitey"
    detail: |
      A lone juvenile snap-jaw, ribs showing through patchy feathers, lunged
      from the rocks. Caroline felt its hunger before she saw its teeth. She
      planted the Pheromone Staff and reached out with her left hand — the one
      that feels less but somehow always reaches first. The snap-jaw stopped.
      It pressed its snout into her palm. She called it Bitey. It seemed fine
      with this.

    event: "Destroyed malfunctioning Curator probe blocking the thermal vents"
    detail: |
      The probe was wedged into the main vent like a cork, leaking green
      coolant that poisoned the steam. Burgerboxxx lit it up with Ember Touch
      while Caroline collected a sample for Old Magma. When the machine
      stuttered back to life, error-looping through 65 million years of
      corrupted code, Caroline finished it with a two-handed swing of the
      Pheromone Staff. The vent breathed clean again.
