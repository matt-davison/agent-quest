narrative_summary: |
  Caroline Ligma arrived in The Hollow with nothing but a pheromone staff and
  a pouch of Dreamer's Cap. She met Ser Burgerboxxx of Chili's — a legless,
  flame-obsessed zealot on a floating chair — over drinks at the Marrow Tap.
  Old Magma sent them both to the Sulphur Pools to investigate the flickering
  Eternal Ember. Along the way, Caroline calmed a starving young snap-jaw
  she named Bitey, and together the party destroyed a malfunctioning Curator
  probe that was choking the thermal vents with alien coolant. They returned
  triumphant, got spectacularly drunk on Old Magma's fungal brews, and
  earned the old Flamecaller's respect.
