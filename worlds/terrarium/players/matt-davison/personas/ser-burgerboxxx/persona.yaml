name: "Ser Burgerboxxx of Chili's"
class: "flamecaller"
active: true
level: 1
xp: 75
backstory: |
  Nobody knows where Ser Burgerboxxx of Chili's came from, and frankly,
  nobody's brave enough to ask twice. He arrived at The Hollow six moons ago,
  drifting in on a humming Curator anti-gravity platform he calls "The
  Hovering Throne" — a disc of alien metal that floats three feet off the
  ground and responds to his weight shifts. He has no legs. He has never
  explained why. When asked, he simply gestures at the Eternal Ember in the
  Marrow Tap and says, "The flame takes what it needs and gives what it must."

  He is enormously fat — a rare achievement in the Terrarium, where most
  calories go toward not being eaten. His bulk overflows the Throne's edges
  like risen dough. He claims the title "Ser," though no knightly order in
  the Terrarium has ever heard of him. He claims to hail from a place called
  "Chili's," which he describes as a sacred temple of flame and sustenance.
  No one has found it on any map. He wields primal fire with genuine,
  terrifying talent, channeling it through a bone censer that he swings in
  wide, enthusiastic arcs while bellowing about purification.

  He is a true believer. The Divine Flame — which he capitalizes when he
  speaks, somehow — is meant to cleanse and purify the unbelievers. He has
  not yet defined "unbelievers" precisely, which keeps everyone nervous. Old
  Magma finds him fascinating. Grunk finds him exhausting. The Maintenance
  Orbs find him a fire hazard. He finds all of them in need of purification.

    event: "Met Old Magma at the Marrow Tap and called her a hag"
    detail: |
      Ser Burgerboxxx arrived at the Marrow Tap trailing ember-smoke and
      scripture. Old Magma — a fellow Flamecaller older than memory — served
      him a brew and listened to his theology with the patience of someone
      who has heard it all. When he called her a hag, she nearly took his
      hand off with a bone poker, then laughed. In that laugh, Ser Burgerboxxx
      heard something he recognized: the crackle of a fire that has burned
      a very long time.

    event: "Purged a profane Curator machine from the sacred thermal vents"
    detail: |
      The Divine Flame's channel was choked by alien blasphemy — a broken
      Curator probe leaking synthetic filth into the holy vents. Ser
      Burgerboxxx brought the fire. Two bolts of Ember Touch cracked the
      machine open. Caroline finished it with her staff. The flame flowed
      freely once more. This, Ser Burgerboxxx knew, was his purpose. Not
      merely to preach the flame, but to clear its path.
