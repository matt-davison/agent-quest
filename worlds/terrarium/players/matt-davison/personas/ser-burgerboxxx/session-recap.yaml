narrative_summary: |
  Ser Burgerboxxx of Chili's brought the word of the Divine Flame to the
  Marrow Tap, where he met Caroline Ligma — a gentle, cannabis-smoking
  Beastwhisperer with leprosy and an unsettling talent for calming things
  he wanted to burn. Old Magma, a fellow Flamecaller, sent them to purge
  a profane Curator machine from the sacred thermal vents beneath the
  Sulphur Pools. The machine was purged. The Divine Flame flowed freely
  once more. In celebration, Ser Burgerboxxx consumed three rounds of
  fungal brew and briefly glimpsed the true face of the Flame in the
  Eternal Ember. It was the most sacred moment of his life, ended by
  his own belch.
