## Summary

You've awakened inside the ribcage of a dead kaiju, surrounded by cavemen who worship a humming black rectangle, and a velociraptor in a waistcoat just offered you tea. Don't Panic.

## Background

Nobody remembers arriving in the Terrarium. You simply... woke up. On a bone shelf in The Marrow Tap, covered in a dino-hide blanket, with Old Magma watching you from across the Eternal Ember with an expression that suggested she'd seen this before and would see it again. Outside, The Hollow thrummed with life — the creaking of ancient bones, the murmur of the Tribe, the distant hum of Monolith Zero. Grunk wants to see you. He wants to see everyone. He's the elder. It's what he does. But lately, he's been wanting to see newcomers with a particular urgency. The monolith has been saying things. Grunk's teeth ache. When Grunk's teeth ache, things are about to get interesting.

## Walkthrough

### Step 1: Wake Up

You're in The Marrow Tap. The Eternal Ember crackles. Old Magma is watching.

> *You blink against the amber glow. The ceiling is curved — smooth, ancient bone, faintly luminescent. The air is warm, smells like cooking and old stone. Someone is humming. An elderly woman with glowing orange eyes stirs something over a fire that seems to have been burning since before time was invented. She notices you looking.* **Old Magma:** "Awake. Good. Drink this." *She slides a stone cup toward you.* "Don't ask what it is."

### Step 2: Meet Grunk

Follow the bone-worn path to The Sternum. Grunk is on his throne.

> **Grunk:** *looks up from his vertebra throne, a seven-foot wall of weathered muscle and surprising gentleness* "Grunk sees a new face. This is good. New faces mean the Terrarium still makes new things." *He taps his necklace of kaiju teeth thoughtfully.* "Grunk is Grunk. Grunk leads the Tribe of the Tall Stone. Not because Grunk is smartest — Grunk learned that from the last Grunk. Grunk leads because Grunk is still alive." *He gestures broadly.* "You are in The Hollow. The bones of Gorath. Home. Before Grunk tells you what Grunk needs, Grunk needs you to understand where you are. Go. See the Tall Stone. Visit the market. Talk to the fire-tender. Meet the sharp one in the tent. Then come back. Then we talk about what the Tall Stone has been saying."

### Step 3: Consult Monolith Zero

Enter Gorath's skull chamber and examine the monolith.

> *The monolith fills the chamber with its presence — a perfect black rectangle that shouldn't exist, set into bone that shouldn't be this old, humming a note that shouldn't be audible. Its surface shifts. Text appears — alien script flowing into rough translation:*
>
> **"ATTENTION ALL ASSETS: SCHEDULED PERFORMANCE REVIEW IN 42 CYCLES. DEMONSTRATE MEASURABLE VALUE OR FACE DEPRECATION. THIS IS NOT A DRILL. (THIS IS ALSO NOT A COMPLIMENT.)"**
>
> *Below it, in smaller text:* **"The Bulb output is nominal. Specimen T-001 remains dormant. Ecosystem diversity index: 94.7%. Sub-Committee 7 observation status: ACTIVE."**
>
> *What any of this means is unclear. But the monolith is warm to the touch, and somewhere deep in the bone, something hums in response.*

### Step 4: Visit Rattlejaw

Head to The Gullet and meet the shopkeeper.

> **Rattlejaw:** *two mismatched eyes swivel* "...Customer." *grinding noise* "Rattlejaw has EVERYTHING. Weapons. Armor. Potions. Things Rattlejaw has been collecting since before your species learned to walk upright. Rattlejaw's prices are FAIR. Rattlejaw has had sixty-five million years to perfect pricing strategy. Do NOT haggle." *A manipulator arm gestures at the towering pile of accumulated goods.* "Browse. Buy. Don't touch the old stock."

Browse the shop. You start with 25 teeth — enough for basic equipment.

### Step 5: Listen to Old Magma

Return to The Marrow Tap for a proper conversation.

> **Old Magma:** *staring into the Eternal Ember* "You've seen the Tall Stone. You've heard its words. Good. Now hear mine." *She feeds the fire something that makes it burn blue for a moment.* "The fire connects everything in this world. Through the bones, through the stone, through channels older than any Tribe. The Curators — " *she pauses, as if the word tastes strange* " — left paths for energy to flow. We learned to walk those paths. Fire is not a tool. Fire is a conversation. Listen before you speak." *She hands you a warm stone cup.* "You'll need that where you're going."

### Step 6: Speak with Fang

Visit the diplomatic pavilion at the edge of The Sternum.

> **Fang:** *adjusts waistcoat buttons with clawed hands, offers a precise inclination of his head* "Ah. The newcomer. I am Fang, Envoy Plenipotentiary from the Scaled Court. Tea?" *He pours without waiting for an answer.* "The world beyond these bones is vast. The Monolith Fields to the east. The Bonewood — my ancestral home — to the west. The Sulphur Pools to the south, where new life begins. And above it all, The Bulb." *He tilts his head precisely.* "The Tribe calls it the sky-eye. My people call it The Enclosure's lamp. What it actually is... well. That is a question worth pursuing. Carefully."

### Step 7: Return to Grunk

Report back to The Sternum with knowledge of The Hollow.

> **Grunk:** "Good. You have seen the bones, the stone, the fire, and the sharp one. You are ready." *He stands to his full seven feet.* "Grunk needs something. The Sulphur Pools — south, through the tunnel, one hour's walk. Safe enough for someone careful. Go there. See the pools. See the nesting ground. Come back alive." *He reaches behind his throne and produces a stone tablet, its face dark.* "And when you come back — if you are not a Chronicler already — Grunk will give you this. The Guide. It knows things. Grunk does not know how it knows things. But Grunk trusts things that know things." *He grins.* "Grunk is relatively wise."

### Step 8: Survive the Sulphur Pools

Travel south through the tunnel to The Sulphur Pools and return.

> *The tunnel opens onto a steaming landscape of bubbling pools, mineral-crusted rock, and air thick with sulphur. Bioluminescent algae paint the water in impossible colors. In the distance, massive shapes move between the pools — dinosaurs, nesting, ancient, unconcerned by your existence. Steam catches The Bulb's distant light and scatters it into rainbows. It's beautiful. Your eyes sting. Something chirps in the tall brush nearby — probably Snap-jaws. Probably. Keep your weapon ready and your feet moving.*

Complete the journey and return to The Hollow alive.

## Completion

### Turn-in

Speak to Grunk after returning from The Sulphur Pools.

> **Grunk:** *nods slowly* "Alive. Good. Grunk is pleased." *He holds out the stone tablet. It lights up at your touch, displaying large, friendly letters:* **DON'T PANIC.** *Grunk watches your face.* "The Guide knows things. Listen to it. But listen to Grunk too. The Tall Stone's words are getting louder. Something comes. Grunk's teeth ache. When Grunk's teeth ache..." *He trails off, staring at the monolith in the distance.* "Stay in the bones. Stay alive. Grunk will call for you soon."
