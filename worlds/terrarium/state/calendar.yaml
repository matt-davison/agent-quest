# World State: Calendar System — Terrarium
# Time is measured in Cycles (one full Bulb oscillation = one year)

version: "1.0"

# === CALENDAR OVERVIEW ===
calendar:
  name: "The Bulb Calendar"
  description: |
    Time in the Terrarium is measured by the oscillation of The Bulb — the
    artificial bioluminescent sun that lights the hollow earth. One full
    brightness cycle equals one year. Twelve months, named by the inhabitants
    for what they observe. The Curators call them "illumination phases" in
    their paperwork. Nobody reads the paperwork.
