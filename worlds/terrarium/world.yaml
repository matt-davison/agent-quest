  Deep beneath the Earth lies the Terrarium — a massive hollow sphere lit by an
  artificial bioluminescent sun called The Bulb, maintained by The Curators —
  a hyper-advanced but hopelessly bureaucratic alien species. They created this
  enclosed ecosystem as "Project 42-B: Sentient Life Viability Study"
  approximately 65 million years ago. (They dropped the asteroid to "reset the
  control group on the surface.") The Terrarium contains: prehistoric megafauna,
  cavemen tribes, kaiju ("unscheduled mutations"), fantasy races ("variant
  phenotype experiments"), and alien tech disguised as natural features. The
  Curators communicate via monoliths, argue about funding, and leak memos the
  inhabitants interpret as "prophecies." Don't Panic.
